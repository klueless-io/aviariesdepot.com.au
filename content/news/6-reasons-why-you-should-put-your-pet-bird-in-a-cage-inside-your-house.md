<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By David Cruwys<br></span></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have a pet bird and absolutely love the experience, you're not alone. Bird ownership is now one of the fastest growing pet trends. According to some pet ownership statistics, there are 7,800,000 pet birds in Australia. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a lot of fowls in domestic environments and is probably why </span><a href="https://www.digsdigs.com/using-bird-cages-for-decor-46-beautiful-ideas/"><b>birdcage decor</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is such big business. Beautiful birds deserve beautiful homes, after all.<br></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many of these owners prefer to keep their pet birds inside the confines of a warm home, as well, which is <g class="gr_ gr_821 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="821" data-gr-id="821">exatly</g> what pet experts have been encouraging bird lovers to do for years.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Far too many well-intentioned owners put their birds outside believing it's good for them.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keeping birds outside actually puts them in mortal danger.<br></span></p> <h1><b>Why Keep Birds Inside</b></h1> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img src="/img/news/6-reasons-why-you-should-put-your-pet-bird-in-a-cage-inside-your-house-1.png" alt="Pet Bird In Birdcage"></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it’s true that birds can naturally survive out in the wild, there are a lot of factors that allow them to do this which don't often apply to pet birds. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One is being able to fly anywhere they want, which allows them to migrate to warmer regions during winter and vice versa during summer. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another is the ability to reach higher places if there are predators about.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many experts agree that even when birds are in cages or aviaries, they would still be exposed to a lot of dangers if they were placed outside. Everything from extreme heat to environmental toxins can still put your birds at risk.</span></p> <h2><b>Vulnerability to extreme temperatures</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the cold bites and the heat whips, humans take shelter right away for good reason. These reasons apply to birds, as well. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep your pet bird in an outdoor cage or aviary, it will have to endure changing temperatures that you have no control over.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insulating an outdoor bird cage won't do much to prevent harsh temperatures from affecting your poor pet either, and poses its own set of problems. Putting up insulation can be hard work.<br></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During times of excessive heat, if the enclosure is located outside where there's no escape from the sun, there's a chance that your pet bird could suffer from hyperthermia and dehydration. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In times of severe cold, a bird's immune system could drop to a point where it becomes susceptible to illnesses.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also weather conditions aside from varying temperatures that you should consider like rain or hail.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you keep your pet birds inside the house with you, they are safe from these conditions since you have more control over your environment. It’s just in their best interest to be indoors, especially when you bought your </span><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/all"><b>bird cages cheap</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p> <h2><b>Pathogens and parasites</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birds that live in <g class="gr_ gr_165 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_hide gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace replaceWithoutSep replaceWithoutSep" id="165" data-gr-id="165">an external enclosures</g> are exposed to a wide range of pathogens and parasites. Cleaning your pet bird's cage can still leave your beaked pet vulnerable, as well, especially if you didn't get every nook and cranny. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you have multiple pet birds, infections can spread quite fast, resulting in all of their deaths.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Common sicknesses like Avian Pox, which is frequent among birds is just one example of what might infect your poor pet. This could be when it makes contact with a sick, wild bird or if it's bitten by a mosquito carrying infected blood.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are mites that could attack your feathered friends. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are lice that can attach to your pet bird and leech off its blood, causing anemia. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are also worms and bacterial vectors that cause a number of diseases such as Psittacosis.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are too many pathogens and parasites to name and too dangerous to expose your pet birds <g class="gr_ gr_126 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="126" data-gr-id="126">to</g>.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's true that there are products out there that can provide relief from these types of parasitic infection, but why take the risk? When it comes to your beloved pets, prevention is always better than cure.<br></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's just no substitute for caution.</span></p> <h2><b>Your pet bird can be a prey</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unlike your bird's wild counterpart, your pet can be much more vulnerable to threats even if it's protected by steel bars. It could fall prey to other animals; dogs, cats, snakes, a larger bird, anything.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once it encounters a hungry predator, you had better hope the cage or aviary you got for them can keep your bird safe. If you're not sure you might want to start shopping for </span><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cages"><b>large bird cages for sale</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even if the enclosure is sturdy enough, the shock of the encounter could also cause your pets to be traumatized. This could cause psychological damage, thus leading to their deaths.</span></p> <h2><b>Flying away and never coming back</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Intelligent birds such as Parrots have the intellectual capability to solve simple puzzles and open cages. Even the most complex, and elaborate lock mechanisms can be a piece of <g class="gr_ gr_149 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-del replaceWithoutSep" id="149" data-gr-id="149">cake,</g> if your pet is smart enough.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aWuc5FtM708" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="" height="360" frameborder="0" width="640"></iframe></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's also the possibility of you forgetting to check and secure the lock on the birdcage.You're only human, after all, and can be prone to distractions.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If this happens outside, there's a good chance that your bird will fly away and you won't ever see it again. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once your bird flew the coop, as they say, it will likely encounter a lot of challenges ahead. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As mentioned in the previous list, your pet could become a meal for predators, get sick, and get caught up in a <g class="gr_ gr_135 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="135" data-gr-id="135">raindstorm</g>.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There's also the substantial amount of stress and shock posed by environmental dangers that may ultimately affect its overall health.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the owner, you could suffer, as well.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Knowing how much danger your pet fowl is <g class="gr_ gr_127 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del" id="127" data-gr-id="127">in</g> can be devastating to your mental health. It's just best to avoid such predicaments and putting your bird indoors is nipping this problem in the bud. <br></span></p> <h2><b>Toxic exposure</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Birds are sensitive creatures and don't fare well in dirty <g class="gr_ gr_125 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="125" data-gr-id="125">environements</g>. Unfortunately, cities can be among the dirtiest environments to expose your pet bird <g class="gr_ gr_160 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling multiReplace" id="160" data-gr-id="160">to</g>.<br></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Passive inhalation of smog from cars, factory chimneys or cigarettes can lead to respiratory diseases, skin irritation, and chronic eye problem to your <g class="gr_ gr_131 gr-alert gr_spell gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim ContextualSpelling ins-del multiReplace" id="131" data-gr-id="131">feathere</g> friend.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There’s also the chance that your bird could be accidentally exposed to bug spray. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No one likes mosquitos in their homes. If you aim wrong and squeeze the can while pointing at an open window with your bird right outside, however, your pet could be the one to suffer.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It's not just man-made toxins that you should look out for, either.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your bird could catch Aspergillosis, a fungal infection that is caused by the Aspergillus fungus. This fungus can be found in wet seed mixtures or in a damp environment. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the spores are inhaled by your bird enters its lungs and air sacs, bronchitis <g class="gr_ gr_132 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Punctuation only-ins replaceWithoutSep" id="132" data-gr-id="132">and</g> pneumonia could set in. <br></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Toxic exposure is a real threat. The best way to protect your birds from it is by keeping them indoors, where toxic exposure is low and you can keep a closer eye on them.</span></p> <h2>In Conclusion</h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><iframe src="https://www.instagram.com/p/BeqLsUlFNyl/embed" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="auto" allowtransparency="false" frameborder="0" onload=""> </iframe> <br></span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it's true that birds deserve to fly free, as the owner, your first responsibility is to keep your pet safe. The good news is that by keeping your bird indoors, you can actually give them more freedom that they just wouldn't get if they were kept outside. </span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can still fly inside your house if it’s spacious enough. You could also just buy a larger </span><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-aviaries"><b>bird aviary</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and give it more space for flight time. <br></span></p>
