<p>Pet birds <strong>need a large amount of equipment</strong>. Fortunately, most of it is easy to acquire. The main thing to be careful about is safety.</p> <p>The main thing to be careful about is safety. In some ways, choosing equipment for your bird is like buying for a small child, and you need to ask yourself the same questions: Is there a choking hazard? Are the colors from safe dyes? What is this made of, and will it hurt Sunny if he swallows some of it?<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>YOUR BIRD NEEDS TWO CAGES</strong><br><br> </h2> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>The main cage is where your bird will be spending the nights, and possibly most of his days, too. It needs to be big enough to spread and flap his wings. <strong>For finches</strong>, w<strong>idth is more important than height</strong>, because they fly across but not up. Parrots climb, so height is almost as useful as width for them. Choose a rectangular cage because it feels more secure to the bird, and be sure that the gaps between the bars are the right width for your bird’s species. Otherwise, a head or foot could be caught. The <strong>second cage</strong> that is needed is a <span style="color: #e69138;"><strong><u>travelling cage</u></strong></span>, to allow you to take your bird to the vet and so on. It is also a <strong>safe haven to keep your bird in when cleaning the big cage.</strong> For more Amazing <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cages" title="bird cage"><strong>birds cage</strong></a> for your birds and other product just visit here <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au<br><br><br></a></p> <h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>PERCHES AND LADDERS<br></strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>It would be ideal to have a <span style="color: #e69138;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">variety of perches</span></strong></span> for your <strong>bird’s comfort</strong>. Most or all of them should be wide enough that the bird’s toes do not overlap around them.</p> <p> A minimum selection to start for most species, would be a <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cage-accessories/products/bird-platform-perch-1" title="wood perch"><strong>natural-wood branch-type perch</strong></a>, a rope perch, a <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cage-accessories/products/wooden-drawbridge-bridge-1" title="WOODEN DRAWBRIDGE BRIDGE"><strong>wooden ladder</strong></a> (a textured plastic one will do for small finches, but wood is better), and a swing.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>CLEANING PRODUCTS</strong><br><br> </h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><strong>Plain white vinegar diluted half-and-half with water</strong> is a good general-purpose cleaner for the <strong>cage and toys</strong>. Any <strong>mild dish soap is appropriate for the food and water containers</strong>. For really tough messes, and organic stains on the rugs, walls, furniture, and so on, an enzyme cleaner in a spray bottle will pay for itself many times over.<br><br>Plain white paper towel and a bottle brush are the only other cleaning equipment that should be needed. However, if you are ill or if you have a compromised immune system, rubber gloves and a face mask may be a wise precaution.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <span style="color: #e69138;"><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/products/4pcs-water-bottle-feeder-1" title="food and water containers" style="color: #e69138;"><strong>FOOD AND WATER DISHES</strong></a></span><br><strong><br></strong> </h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">There are two main <strong>types of dish pet birds</strong>: the hopper and the bowl.<br><br><strong>Hoppers</strong> that fit through the bars of the cage are a <strong>popular choice for budgies and canaries</strong>. They have the advantage of cutting down on evaporation, for water, and of cutting down on mess, for seeds and pellets.<br><br>It is more difficult for a bird to hurt or drown himself with a hopper, which is why hoppers are used for less-intelligent farm fowl such as domestic turkeys. Some people even believe that their pets won’t foul the water with food or droppings if a hopper is used, but don’t be fooled. The <strong>hopper still needs to be cleaned every day.<br><br><br></strong></p> <h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #e69138;"><a href="https://amzn.to/2M52fPs" target="_blank" title="SPI Home 33562 Curious Cat and Bird Birdbath" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #e69138;"><strong>BIRD BATH</strong></a></span></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Just like humans, some birds might prefer a shower though. It’s possible to merely use a spray bottle for this effect, with the mist-effect often being a favorite amongst the likes of finches and cockatiels. If you are opting for a bath, a plastic option will suffice. There are umpteen baths available on the market and many are designed for different species, with their design dependent on their size etc.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>BIRD TOYS</strong><br><br> </h2> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Something else that we have already touched upon is bird toys. Foraging toys have already been discussed, and are always recommended, but this <strong>isn’t the only toy</strong> you should provide for your bird.<br><br>Anything <strong>chew-related is always recommended</strong>, particularly if you have a hook-billed bird. These <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-toys" title="bird chew toys"><strong>chew toys</strong></a> will keep such birds occupied for an age and if you can find one made from either wood, twisted paper or cardboard, you’ll have provided them with the perfect stimulation.<br><br>A lot of owners don’t realize that birds are very much like small children in the way that many of them like soft toys. A lot of species will simply love to cuddle up to a cuddly toy but again, size matters, and the size of the toy will largely depend on the size of the bird. If you have a type of bird who would naturally live in thick foliage, make sure that the cage has enough areas where they can hide these toys in so they feel completely at home.

It means that your <strong>cage needs to replicate this</strong>, with <strong>perches and ladders</strong> helping to form the optimum environment. As you will have probably been able to gather from this guide so far, there are different requirements based on the type of bird you have.<br><br> It means that you should only acquire perches that are large enough so that the toes of the bird don’t overlap. As well as this, the material matters, and anything made from natural-wood is sure to be a winner for most species. In relation to ladders, ones of the wooden variety are also recommended. While some birds, such as <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/best-things-comes-in-small-packages-the-finch" title="Best Things Come in Small Packages "><strong>finches</strong></a>, might like textured plastic ones, on the whole a wood option is always advised. In a similar vein, a lot of birds like to have a <strong>swing in their cage</strong>, if space allows.You can also check here <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au<br><br><br></a></p> <p style="float: right;">.</p> <h2> <strong>KEEP YOUR BIRDS TOOL AND EQUIPMENTS CLEAN</strong><br><br><br> </h2> <p>If you own a pet bird then you know just how much time and effort is required to provide them with proper care. From Finches and Softbills to Parrots and Quails pet birds have a wide range <a href="http://www.lovethatpet.com/small-pets/birds/bird-food/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dietary</a>, housing, <a href="http://www.lovethatpet.com/small-pets/birds/cleaning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaning</a> and <a href="http://www.lovethatpet.com/small-pets/birds/bird-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">training</a> needs that are specific to their species and environment.</p> <p>There’s no getting around it, <strong>birds are messy</strong>. Given a chance and the proper tools, they keep themselves clean and well-groomed, but you’ll need to clean their cage.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p><u>Birds</u> spend an average of a third of their waking time preening and grooming themselves. If they are flocking birds, as most pet birds are, they might groom each other, too. As long as they are <strong>not actively pulling out their feathers</strong> (a potentially-dangerous condition known as ‘<strong>French moult</strong>’), this self-grooming is a good thing.

For most water birds, grooming also allows the animal to water-proof its coat so it can both keep warm in the water and avoid uncontrolled sinking. Keeping the bird’s home clean is your responsibility, however. This is a constant effort, as the cage should be cleaned every day and the surrounding area will need to be tended frequently. However, it doesn’t need to be difficult. A little preventative maintenance can work wonders.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"> <strong>How to Keep Bird Toys &amp; Accessories Clean</strong><br><br> </h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Even in the cleanest cage, <strong>unclean toys and accessories</strong> increase the likelihood of <strong>transmitting harmful bacteria and disease</strong> especially since your bird has so much beak contact with them. We <strong>recommend you to clean toys and accessories weekly, right along with your cage cleaning regimen</strong>. Birds are extremely sensitive to cleaning solutions, so if you are using strong cleaners or disinfectants (like mild bleach solutions), please move your bird to another cage in a different room and close the door before you begin. Next, remove all toys and accessories from the cage. Check them over for seeds, droppings, etc., and remove before washing since the presence of organic material will prevent disinfectants from working properly. Then, wash them in hot, soapy water, disinfect them, and rinse them well in running water.

These easy-to-use products can be used directly on your bird's toys and accessories and allow you to quickly clean, deodorize, and sanitize while reducing the need to scrub and deep clean. By using commercial cleaning and disinfecting products, you can spend less time cleaning and more time bonding with your pet bird.<strong>Toys and accessories must be completely dry</strong> before they are placed back in the cage. It saves a lot of time to have two sets of perches and a variety of toys.</p> <p>That way, clean, dry replacements can be quickly placed in the cage while the other set dries. This also helps alleviate boredom and deters negative behaviors. Remember to discard any perch or toy that does not come clean, is frayed, or is broken.Once your bird's cage, toys, and accessories have been cleaned and thoroughly dried, reassemble everything and return your bird to his home. He can happily play in his safe environment and you can smile knowing you've completed another successful cleaning routine.

Newspaper (black and white ink only, since some colored ink may be toxic) and other paper liners are a good choice since they are easily replaced and allow for good observation of the droppings. For smaller birds, some people place several layers of liner in the cage, so they only have to remove the top one. If you follow this procedure, make sure the remaining liners are clean and water or droppings have not soaked through.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Dishes: </strong></h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-10.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 5px;">Food and water dishes should be washed in hot, soapy water, and dried thoroughly. Do not clean the dishes in areas where food is prepared. To provide more cleaning power, some people wash them in the dishwasher or use a disinfectant. Be sure no trace of soap or disinfectant remains on the dishes.<br><br>The food dishes <strong>need to be absolutely dry before adding food</strong>, since damp seed or pellets can quickly mold. To avoid waste, fill the dishes with only the amount the bird will eat until the dishes are cleaned again.A good alternative is to have two or more sets of dishes, so while one set is being cleaned, the other set can be used in the cage.<br><br>Stainless steel or high impact plastic dishes are recommended since they clean easily and can withstand repeated washings, hot water, and disinfectants.If you use a water bottle, use a bottlebrush to clean it thoroughly. Again, having two or more bottles available often makes cleanup easier. Check the bottle to make sure the ball is loose and works properly.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Accessories:</strong></span> </h3> <p>If you have a birdbath in the <u>cage</u>, it should be removed, washed in hot soapy water and/or disinfectant, rinsed very well, and refilled with fresh water. Any accumulations of droppings on perches or <u>toys</u> should be removed.<br><br><br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Surrounding area:</strong></span></h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-11.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Sweep or vacuum (a small hand-held vacuum is handy) the floor to remove seeds, hulls, feathers, and other debris. A cage apron can help collect this material, and can be removed and emptied daily. If the area is carpeted, a plastic carpet liner or a mat designed for use under an office chair, is a good idea since it can be easily cleaned and disinfected.</p> <h3><strong><span style="color: #38761d;">Weekly And Monthly Cage Cleaning</span><br></strong></h3> <p>How often you need to do a major cleanup of the cage and contents somewhat depends on the type and number of birds you have, <strong>size of cage</strong>, how much time your bird spends in it, etc. Generally, the cages of larger birds, and <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><strong>Lories and Lorikeets</strong></span> need to be cleaned thoroughly on a weekly basis. For some smaller birds, monthly cleaning may be sufficient. Follow these 7 steps in your cleaning routine. Supplies should include:</p> <ul> <li>Cage liners</li> <li>Paper towels and/or cage wipes</li> <li>Cleaning cloths</li> <li>Bird-safe disinfectant</li> <li>Sandpaper</li> <li>Scrub brush and/or old toothbrush</li> </ul> <p><br>When cleaning, place a garbage can next to the cage, to make it easier…</p> <ul></ul> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-equipment-12.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <ul> <li>Remove the bird to safe surroundings, preferably to an alternate cage in another room where he will not be exposed to any fumes from the cleaning supplies.<br><br> </li> <li>Remove all toys and accessories from the cage.<br><br> </li> <li>Remove any seeds or loose droppings from the cage. Scrub the cage with hot soapy water. Some people place the cage in the tub or shower and use a hand-held spray to help wash it out. Rinse the cage well with plain water, and then soak or spray it down with a disinfectant. Rinse it thoroughly and let it dry completely before replacing clean toys and perches. Air dry the cage in the sun, if possible.<br><br> </li> <li>Remove droppings from perches and toys with a common dishwashing detergent. Sandpaper can help to remove droppings from wooden perches, blocks, and toys. As with the cage, wash and rinse the perches and toys before using a disinfectant. Some wood, plastic, or stiff rope toys and perches are dishwasher safe. Softer ropes can be placed in the washing machine. Once clean, disinfect all items and rinse thoroughly.<br><br> </li> <li>Toys and perches must be completely dry before they are placed back in the cage with the bird. Air dry them in the sun, if possible, or dry them in the oven at 250 for 10-15 minutes. Again, it often saves a lot of time to have two sets of perches and toys so dry, clean ones can be quickly placed in the cage while the other set dries. Discard any perch or toy that does not come clean, is frayed, or broken.<br><br> </li> <li>Empty and wash the cage apron and clean the area underneath the cage. Tile flooring, vinyl, and plastic carpet runners can be washed and disinfected. You may want to check the walls too, since food or other material may have been flung against them by the bird.<br><br> </li> <li>Place all the dry items back in the dry cage, put in a clean liner, fill the food and water dishes, and pat yourself on the back as you bring your bird back, to his sparkling home.</li> </ul> <br><br> If you own a pet bird then you know just how much time and effort is required to provide them with <strong>proper care</strong>. <br> <ul></ul> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
