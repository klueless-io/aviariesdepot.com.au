<p> Being a large, brilliantly coloured bird, <strong>King parrots</strong> are conspicuous and never fail to impress, irrespective of how familiar they may be to the observer. The adult male is a particularly striking bird having a bright scarlet head, neck, breast and abdomen, dark green mantle, back and wings, longitudinal turquoise-green stripe on the wing coverts, dark blue lower back and rump, black tail feathers and a red upper mandible, tipped black.</p> <p>The adult female has a dark green head, wings and back, dull green throat and upper breast tinged red, scarlet lower breast and abdomen, faint pale green wing stripe, blue lower back and rump, tinged green and a dark brown mandible. <br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Personality</strong><br><br> </h2> <p style="float: right;"><u><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-king-parrot-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a></u><strong>King Parrots </strong>are not only incredibly beautiful, but also quiet (other than the occasional shrill sentinel call) and gentle in nature.<br><br>They are <strong>quite different from other parrot species</strong> that tend to be noisier, more destructive and more aggressive than they tend to be.<br><br>They are <strong>not known to be cuddly birds,</strong> but these gentle creatures do become very confiding and have a knack for entertaining themselves.<br><br>Because they are so quiet and colorful they are very much in demand as <strong>aviary birds</strong>.<br><br>King Parrots are <strong>social birds</strong> and <strong>do require daily interaction with their flock</strong> -- be it with other birds in an aviary setting or with their human family.<br><br>In an aviary setting, they do well even when kept with smaller birds.<br><br>It is important to remember that these parrots require space to accommodate their activities and their long tails. The width is considered more important in the long-tailed species rather than height in a cage -- but remember, the biggest cage possible is always the best choice. However, they are best kept in a planted aviary that allows them plenty of room to fly from perch to perch.

The <strong>King Parrot</strong> is found in coastal and connecting mountain regions of eastern Australia, excluding Tasmania.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Breeding</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>Australian King parrot <strong>lay down 3 to 6 eggs</strong> in each clutch that incubates about 20 days while male remain nearby. The clicks fledged after 5 weeks after then remain with parents until come at maturity age.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-king-parrot-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>The perfect coloration on their body comes after 3 years. After 3 years these hatches become able for breeding. The best breeding result when you provide all vitamins and minerals that needed for their good health.</p> <p>The breeding season lasts from September to January. King parrots nest in a hollow limb or hole in a tree, usually in the trunk of a tall tree standing in or at the edge of a forest. A favored site is in the hollow trunk of an eucalyptus entrance being where a limb has broken off, and the hollow is usually very deep with eggs being at or near ground level.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>DIET</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>King parrot <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2M5z4f6" target="_blank" title="Audubon Park 12261 Black Oil Sunflower Seed Wild Bird Food" rel="noopener noreferrer">feed on seeds</a>,</strong> fruit, berries, nuts, nectar, blossoms, leaf buds, insects and their larvae. Seeds of eucalyptus, angophoras and acacias make up a major proportion of the diet, and these are procured mostly in the trees and shrubs.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>BEHAVIOR</strong> <br><br> </h2> <p style="float: left;"><u><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-king-parrot-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></u><strong>Australian King-Parrot</strong> feeds mainly in <strong>trees</strong>. It is mostly arboreal, and comes down to the ground for drinking and feeding on fallen seeds.<br><br>This parrot is less noisy or active than other species. It can cause damage in orchards when they feed in flock.<br><br>They feed silently into vegetation. If it is disturbed, it flies off through the forest.<br><br>Australian King-Parrot is often seen in pairs or small flocks. During breeding season, male performs some displays. It stretches its body, tightens its body plumage, but it ruffs its head feathers. Then, it shakes or flicks its wings in order to display the light green barring.<br><br>During these displays, it utters harsh calls, and contracts its pupils to accentuate the yellow iris. Female responds in the same way, bobbing her head and begging food. Male usually regurgitates food to her. Pairs mate for life.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Emotional Well-Being</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>These beautiful parrots are not well known outside of Australia. They can make sweet pet birds and are commonly kept by those living in the Australian area.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-king-parrot-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>All pet parrots should have colorful toys, human companionship, a <strong>comfortable cage</strong>, and <strong>good nutrition</strong>.You can also visit at online stores like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au</a> for more product for your birds specially <strong>Birds toys, birds cage, birds accessories and more.</strong> <br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>PROTECTION / THREATS / STATUS</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>Australian King-Parrot populations are stable or increasing recently, probably because food is available in mature gardens, and birds can survive the winter.

An appropriate seed would be a small parrot mix, which should contain a variety of seeds such as french white millet, plain canary, hulled oats, pannicum, japanese millet, saff flower and sunflower. <br><br>Grit assists with digestion so small amounts should be added to their daily seed. Seed lacks important vitamins and minerals so their daily diet should be supplemented with small portions of fresh fruit and vegetables such as apple, carrot, beans, peas, corn, broccoli and spinach.<br><br><strong>Never feed</strong> your King Parrot <strong>lettuce or avocado</strong>, and <strong>always remove the seeds from apples</strong>. Fruit and vegetables should not be left for prolonged periods of time as they will easily spoil and this can lead to illness from the bacteria and yeasts that grow on spoilt produce.
