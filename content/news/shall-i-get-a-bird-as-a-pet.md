<p>Birds provide companionship and enjoyment with a lot less work. Here are just a few of the reasons a pet bird might be the best option for you. <br><br></p> <h2><strong>Birds Are Smart And Intelligent</strong></h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-1.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Bird intelligence has been studied through several attributes and abilities. Birds in the <strong>crow family and parrots</strong> have been shown to live socially, have long developmental periods, and possess large fore-brains, and these may be expected to allow for greater cognitive abilities. Counting has been considered an ability that shows intelligence. 1960s evidence had suggested that crows may count up to 3 and parrots can count up to 6. Many birds are also able to detect changes in the number of eggs in their nest and brood. <br><br>Visual or auditory signals and their <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/foods-and-treats-for-bird" title="foods and treats for birds"><strong>association with food</strong></a> and other rewards have been well studied, and birds have been trained to recognize and distinguish complex shapes. This is probably an important ability that aids their survival.</p> <p style="float: left;">Social life has been considered to be a driving force for the evolution of intelligence. Many birds have social organizations, and loose aggregations are common. Many species separate into small family groups for activities such as nesting and territorial defense. The birds then <strong>congregate in massive flocks</strong> made up of several different species for migratory purposes. <br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Some birds use <strong>teamwork while hunting</strong>. Predatory birds hunting in pairs have been observed using a "<strong>bait and switch</strong>" technique, whereby one bird will distract the prey while the other swoops in for the kill. <br><br>Social behavior requires individual identification, and most birds appear to be capable of recognizing mates, siblings and young. <br><br>Other behaviors such as play and cooperative breeding are also considered indicators of intelligence.When crows are catching food, they appear to be sensitive to note who is watching them hide the food. They also steal food caught by others. <br><br>Birds communicate with their flock-mates through song, calls, and body language. Studies have shown that the intricate territorial songs of some birds must be learned at an early age, and that the memory of the song will serve the bird for the rest of its life. Some bird species are able to communicate in several regional varieties of their songs. When a territory-owning male of the species dies, a young male will immediately take his place, singing to prospective mates in the dialect appropriate to the territory he is in.<span> </span></p> <p style="float: right;"><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The greater the competition in the area, the more likely the birds actually creates or makes their song more complex. <br><br>Recent studies indicate that some birds may have an ability to memorize "<strong>syntactic</strong>" patterns of sounds, and that they can be taught to reject the ones determined to be incorrect by the human trainers. Among the most popular pets, chickadees, parrots, and cockatoos all have finely-honed problem solving and mimicking skills.<br><br></p> <h2><strong>Birds Are Low Maintenance</strong></h2> <p>When it comes to finances for pet maintenance, birds seem to outrank cats, dogs, and other domestic animals. That is because several bird species need a certain <strong>level of attention</strong> and some socializing activities, which could be very time-consuming. Birds are <strong>easier to care for</strong>. While there is no such species as a no-maintenance bird.<br><br></p> <h4><span style="color: #bf9000;"><strong>There are actually bird species those that do not require much care</strong>.</span></h4> <ol> <li><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>Pigeons and Doves</strong></span></li> </ol> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/raising-pigeons" title="raising pigeons"><strong>Domestic pigeons</strong></a> and doves make great pets. Good natured and mellow, they love both their own kind and people and they are easy to care for. <p>They’re quiet, smart and social. They don’t bite, pluck, or chew and are low maintenance pets. They are masters of the leisure arts – napping, flirting, sunbathing and nest sitting. They are domesticated and cannot survive in the wild.</p> <p>A predator-safe, protected enclosure, food, water, grit, greens and companionship is all they ask.</p> <p>Doves are medium-sized birds that enjoy spending time with their owners. Unlike the larger bird breeds like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw" title="scarlet macaw"><strong>macaws</strong></a> and cockatoos, these winged species do not need so much attention. They are just content with spending their day entertaining themselves.</p> <p>However, because they are smaller than parrots, they don’t produce so much mess, which means the need to clean up the<span> </span>bird cages is reduced. Although it is still important to bond with them, you don’t have to worry so much because they are just quiet. Just keep their <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/birds-proper-hygiene" title="birds hygiene"><strong>bird cages clean</strong></a> and they’ll be contented and happy.<br><br></p> <ol start="2"> <li><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>Finches</strong></span></li> </ol> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Finches <strong>need spacious housing</strong>. These birds should remain fully flighted instead of having trimmed wing feathers. A horizontal cage is a must (as opposed to a vertical cage). Finches are <strong>flock animals</strong> and thrive when housed with other finches. They don’t need playtime outside the cage and handling. As long as they are with their same kind, they would socialize and interact with their fellow finches than with humans.<span> </span><br><br>If you house pairs of finches together, be prepared for possible offspring, especially if the finches are provided a nest (small wicker-basket) and nesting material. Some finches can be housed in same-sex pairs (a male finch with a male finch or a female finch with a female finch) to avoid the possibility of breeding but it depends on the finch species as well as possibly the time of the year.<span> </span><br><br>Putting up an<span> </span><a href="https://amzn.to/2M717ei" target="_blank" title=" Bird Ferret Parrot Cage Aviary Cat Budgie Hamster House W Castor" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>aviary</strong></a> need the expertise of an <strong>experienced finch breeder</strong> some finch species can be aggressive toward other finch species, especially during breeding season. A finch will thrive when feed with the right foods, provided with clean water, and <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cages" title="bird cages"><strong>clean bird cages</strong></a>. Finches can be very messy and there is a need to clean their cages once in a while.<br><br></p> <ol start="3"> <li><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>Cockatiels</strong></span></li> </ol> <br> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Cockatiels are <strong>loveable and affectionate</strong>. They require less space. They are easy to breed, gentle, and love to be handled and stroked. Cockatiels make a soft chirping sound and are easy to tame, inexpensive and simple to maintain. They are relatively quiet bird and known for their whistling ability. They readily adapt to new surroundings and activities, intelligent, curious and easily amused with simple<span> </span><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-toys" title="bird toys"><strong>bird toys</strong></a>. Just like we can find on online stores like<span> at </span><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><u>aviariesdepot.com.au/</u></a>. <br><br>Cockatiels are sociable in nature and may bond with humans, cage mates, toys and other cage furnishings. Courtship, mating behavior and egg-laying commonly result. They may be given seeds that are high in fat and clean, fresh water should be provided daily.<br><br></p> <ol start="4"> <li><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>Parakeets</strong></span></li> </ol> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Parakeets provide a restful ambiance by their cute chirps, tweets and songs. Though they are considered low-maintenance pets, parakeets do need some attention. They require some form of social activity and another pet parakeet to erase loneliness. <br><br>When buying another parakeet, it is advised to <strong>raise the birds separately</strong> and <strong>introduce them when they are full grown</strong>. This will ensure that the birds will bond to humans rather than just bonding to each other.</p> <p>Adding a mirror as a <strong>cage accessory</strong> will also help birds stay happy. Offering your pet parakeet a number of <strong>different seeds</strong> and treats will help to keep it healthy and happy.</p> <p>Singing or playing music can cultivate the innate skill of a parakeet as they are being extremely vocal creatures, though not very loud, their noises provide a calming mood. Parakeets <strong>hate dirty bird cages</strong>, and it is important to clean their bird cages. A scrub brush and hose will do the job for easy clean- up of their cage.</p> <p>Parakeets love to manipulate objects and play, adding some<strong> <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/all" title="bird cage accessories">cage accessories</a></strong> is advised making sure no unsafe objects or small parts of the cage are introduced. There are thousands of different<span> </span><strong>bird toys available</strong>, you may also visit online shops like<span> </span><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><u>aviariesdepot.com.au</u></a> and you don't have to spend a ton of cash on cheap items, because parakeets will play with just about anything. If it spins, is shiny or makes noise you can bet that your bird will absolutely love it. Consistently, approach your parakeet, with no grabbing nor sudden movements, for these fragile pets are quick to feel fear. They are fragile and it is important that they will trust you.<br><br></p> <ol start="5"> <li><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>Canaries</strong></span></li> </ol> <p> </p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-8.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">For pet owners, who prefer to raise pets that can just be heard and seen, canaries are the perfect choice. Like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/best-things-comes-in-small-packages-the-finch" title="Finches"><strong>finches</strong></a>, they don’t appreciate human handling. Instead, they prefer to be within the corners of their<span> </span>bird cages.<br><br>Proper housing for a canary is important to keep it healthy and be happy.<br><br>Canaries should have <strong>its own cage</strong> as they are territorial and do not like to be housed together. With proper care Canaries can live more than 14 years.<span> </span>Nutrition of this bird include birdseed and pellets .<br><br>Canaries are available for sale in many pet stores, from avian-specialty shops as well as direct from bird breeders. They are less likely to be available for adoption from avian-rescue organizations, which are more focused on parrot species in need of homes.<br><br><br></p> <ol start="6"> <li><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>Lovebirds</strong></span></li> </ol> <p> </p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-9.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Lovebirds love to exercise and require a <strong>large bird cage</strong>﻿ (see: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand-alone Budgie Perch Castor Wheels Large 140cm "}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2JIXLfe%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20" target="_blank" title="Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand-alone Budgie Perch Castor Wheels" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand-alone Budgie Perch Castor Wheels - amazon</strong></a>) </span> as small cages make these birds tend to be neurotic and develop self-mutilating habits.<span> </span><strong>Toys</strong> are a must for these active parrots. <br><br>Keep in mind that lovebirds are strong chewers, so choose <strong>toys that can stand up to chewing</strong> without causing a hazard. With proper care and a well-balanced diet, a lovebird can live between 12 and 15 or more years.</p> <p> </p> <h4><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Good nutrition of Lovebirds include:</strong></span></h4> <ul> <li>water,</li> <li>protein,</li> <li>carbohydrates and fiber,</li> <li>lipids, minerals, and vitamins.</li> <li>A seed-only diet is a recipe for malnutrition, and malnutrition causes many nutrition-related ailments.</li> </ul> <p>The best lovebird feeding option is formulated diets that include the essential nutrients and don’t give a bird the choice to pick through and eat only the bits he likes. Variety is also important for birds, so supplement formulated diets with bird-safe vegetables, fruit, and even healthy table foods (minus any sauces or seasoning). Learn which foods to avoid, and always ask your veterinarian before offering a food to your lovebird if you have any concerns.</p> <p>As their name suggests, lovebirds are affectionate and very charming and they must be kept as a pair.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Birds Require Minimal Grooming</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-10.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> Birds need to be<span> </span><strong>groomed and cleaned</strong>, from nail trimming to wing clipping. Birds tend to their feathers through preening, which can be activated with water, so a<span> </span><a href="https://amzn.to/2M52fPs" target="_blank" title="bird bath" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>bird bath is a must</strong></a>. <p>Remember to keep the bathing dish shallow (1/2 inch for small birds and 1 inch for large birds). A <span style="color: #f6b26b;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">bath products</span></strong></span> like<span> </span><span style="color: #f6b26b;"><strong><u>bird shampoo</u></strong></span> and<span> </span><strong><span style="color: #f6b26b;"><u>conditioner</u></span></strong> can also be purchased to add to your water dish. For your bird bath supplies and other bird accessories, you may like to visit online stores like the <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><u>aviaries-depot</u></a><strong>.</strong></p> <p>Long nails make grasping the perch difficult and could cause long-term foot abnormalities. Nails are naturally worn down in nature, but because your bird's home is indoors, a little help is needed. In order to avoid injury for both your bird and you, ensure nails are trimmed. Mineral perches also help keep nails short.</p> <p>It is important to<span> </span><strong>trim bird’s wings</strong> so they won’t escape to other territories. There are blood feathers (new feathers initially filled with blood which disappear one feathers has fully grown) that must be avoided being clipped.</p> <p>A blood feather’s shaft (rachis) appears to be dark in color versus a clear or white shaft. If you accidentally clip a blood feather, you must pull it out from the base and apply a blood-stopping powder and pressure until the bleeding stops. If a cut blood feather is left unattended, the bird could experience significant blood loss.<br><br></p> <h2><strong>Birds Are Social Creatures</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-11.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <p>Birds are<strong> inherently social creatures</strong>, because there is always safety in numbers. But on the other hand, social structures of birds may be much more complex than that.</p> <p>A new study showed that with their unusually large brains relative to their body size and advanced cognition, parrots live in a complex social environment. Given proper training and socialization, birds can be every bit as loving and affectionate as a cat or dog.</p> <p>Some pet birds are inseparable from their owners, even accompanying them on daily errands such as trips to the bank or grocery store (obviously this isn't the best choice in colder climates). And birds can be easily trained to do simple tricks and tasks since they are highly intelligent.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Birds Are Inexpensive To Feed</strong></h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-12.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Providing our feathered friends with high quality pellet diet is important yet, we can likewise feed them with <strong>food in our home</strong> making sure that these foods are <strong>not toxic</strong> to our birds. Additional nutrients and variety is also important. Fruits and veggies provide beneficial vitamins, minerals, and carbohydrates.<br><br>Many bird foods include fruit and veggies to vary flavors and textures while maximizing nutrition. The levels of vitamins in these products is guaranteed as listed in the guaranteed analysis in products "<strong>More Information</strong>".<br><br>Vitamins ensure that foods support body systems, plumage, bones, and more. Artificial coloring does not automatically compromise nutritional value. In fact, many bird foods are carefully formulated with food-safe colorings because many birds will eat only vibrantly colored food; Much like excess fat, excess sugars in bird food can quickly lead to obesity.</p> <p>Many bird foods include naturally sweet ingredients. Added sweeteners include honey, corn syrup, and molasses. Monitor your bird's consumption of sweets; Omega-3 fatty acids support skin and feather health and also healthy joints, immune system, heart, brains, and eyes as well as overall well-being. Guaranteed levels of Omega-3 fatty acids are found in all other bird foods.

The bird needs enough room to be able to walk around and flap its wings vigorously without hitting them on anything. <strong>Bird toys</strong>, <strong>food bowls</strong> and <strong>perches</strong> need to be taken into considering for occupying space.<br><br>A good rule of thumb, is to allow for no fewer than 18 inches by 18 inches of floor space per bird, with medium birds requiring at least 24 inches by 30 inches and large birds needing even more space. A bird cage should be longer than they are tall because birds fly from side to side, not up and down. Canaries and finches particularly like to fly back and forth from perch to perch. Vertical cages are unstable and can fall over easily.<br><br>Small bird species, such as budgies, canaries, and finches, are good options for people who live in apartments or condominiums with limited space. While larger pets require extra room to romp and play, a <strong>small bird's cage</strong> can easily fit into a cozier living space. <br><br></p> <p><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Birds Are Long-Lived Companions</strong></h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet-14.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Pet birds make decorative and entertaining additions to the home and, with good care, can live long and happy lives. Large and airy cages, a high-quality and varied diet, plenty of opportunity for play and good veterinary care will prolong your little feathered friend's lifespan.<br><br>Parrots are expected to live around 25 years; Cockatiels fairly lived reaching 25-30 years; Lories and lorikeets live roughly 15 to 20 years, with males living longer than the females. Cockatoos are longer-lived, often reaching 40 years or more. Lovebirds are the shortest-lived at, on average, about 10 years.<br><br>While most birds are happier with a companion, love birds interact with humans better if they don't have a mate.</p> <p>Canaries are expected to live 10 to 15 years, and even up to 25 years with top-notch care. Finches are among the smallest and the shortest-lived of all pet birds. On average they only live about 5 years, but can reach up to 20. Finches live in flocks so are happier with companions, but quarantine new birds in another room before introducing them to your pet.</p> <p>So whatever breed you choose be prepared for a long and happy life together with your pet bird. <br><br><strong>A</strong> <strong>bonus:</strong> Your bird will always be there to listen to you complain about your crappy day and comfort you with a sympathetic chirp.</p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
