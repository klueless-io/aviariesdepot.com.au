<p>When you ask someone to picture out a parrot, they will immediately think of a red bird with rainbows for wings, right? That is because the <strong>Scarlett Macaw is the most recognized parrot breed in the world</strong>. There is nothing more flashier than this bird and is one of the most common picks for bird fanciers and novice breeders alike. It is not unusual for other people that their introduction to the wonderful world of pet birds started first in owning their very first Scarlett Macaw (thought this magnificent bird is not a great choice for newbies due to its high maintenance).<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Physical Appearance...<br><br></strong></h2> <p>This grandiose bird varies in sizes from 80 to a hundred cm in length, and, as its name suggest, is <strong>primarily scarlet in color</strong>. With a band of yellow in the center of its wings, followed by a band of blue leading to the tips of their flight feathers. In some other birds, there is also a visible green band between the yellow and blue bands on their wings.</p> <p>This beautiful, <strong>yet high-maintenance pet bird</strong> requires an experienced bird owner, or someone who is very dedicated into learning about them, and providing the <strong>appropriate environment</strong> and care for this magnificent parrot (even to the point of bankruptcy). In the wild, macaws are used to "<strong>modifying</strong>" their environment, that is by chewing on branches and creating a nest to raise their chicks. For domestic Scarlet macaws (who are used to be with a human companion than to be in the wild) , they will continue to chew and explore (of course, with their beak) anything around them that gets their attention or piques their curiosity. Training your scarlet macaw is the key to assimilate them into the family, and establish decent behavior.</p> <p>Scarlet macaws live a long life, living for approximately 40 to 50 years and there are even some reports that the can reach up to 80 years. So owning a scarlet macaw is not just like owning other pets like dogs or cats (which have an average of 15 to 20 years lifespan), this is a pet "for life", and they even may outlive you. (one you got yourself a Scarlet macaw, you are tied to it FOR LIFE!)<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Origins and Current Status in the Wild</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Scarlet macaws (<strong>Scientific name: </strong><em><strong>Ara macao</strong>)</em>, just like other common medium-sized parrot breeds, are <strong>native to the dense rainforests and jungles of Central and South America.</strong></p> <p>This unique macaw has <strong>two subspecies</strong>;</p> <h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Ara macao cyanoptera</strong></span></h3> <p>which is <strong>endemic in Central America</strong>, primarily from the countries of Belize, Guatemala, Panama, Mexico, and Nicaragua; and </p> <ul></ul> <h3 style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Ara macao macao</strong></span></h3> <p>which <strong>originates in South America</strong>, that includes the countries of Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Peru, Suriname, and Venezuela.</p> <ul></ul> <p>With such beauty, there is a great price to pay. Scarlet macaws are rarely seen in the wild, due to <strong>losing their <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/birds-habitat" title="Birds Habitat ">habitat</a> and excessive capture for the pet trade</strong>. Luckily, local authorities and environmental organizations, together with local nature advocates (especially in countries like Costa Rica and other South American countries), are doing all their best to bring back the original population of these colorful birds in the wild by breeding them in captivity and reintroducing them back in the wild after reaching the age of maturity.</p> <p>Aside from this, government units of most Central and South American countries passed laws that heavily punishes whoever caught in the act (or is suspected) of smuggling and participating in the illegal pet trade of these exotic birds (some people would pay thousands just to have one scarlet macaw) . <strong>Other factors that affect their dwindling number</strong> in the wild includes <strong>deforestation, trapping for food and feathers, and spraying pesticides</strong> (<span style="color: #351c75;">which are highly toxic to them</span>) on nearby fields and plantations. <br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Temperament</strong></h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Aside from their gorgeous looks, The scarlet macaw is also known to be "<strong>sassy" bird,</strong> filled with vigor and character. It is a very smart bird and is known to open hinges of their cage in order to escape.<br><br>Sometimes, scarlet macaws tend to be very choosy on particular things and might <strong>get attached to only one person</strong> (usually the person who raised him, feeds him and gives him the most attention) <strong>and may shun other people around him</strong> (or even bite them if they try to get near him or his "human").<br><br>To avoid this, it is ideal to train your scarlet macaw to recognize other people around the house when it was still young.<br><br>If talking about intelligence then the scarlet macaw is gonna be on the top 3 smartest birds in the world. When in captivity and on the hands of a capable owner or trainer, scarlet macaws are able to mimic words and sounds and learn tricks, from the basic ones even to the most complicated of tasks, and they are even a staple in pretty much any pet bird shows in zoos worldwide.<br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">They are also smart enough to distinguish colors and shapes (of course, with the guide of a capable trainer) and <strong>some of these birds are able to solve simple math problems.</strong><br><br>Scarlet macaws takes pleasure in being an essential part of their human and animal family, anxiously fitting in on pretty much anything they do. Adaptable and extremely easy to live with, they are not immune from becoming spoiled, which may lead to squawking or biting for their owner's attention or out of anger. However, they quickly correct their <strong>behavior</strong> if the situation is worked out in their favor or is dealt with appropriately.<br><br>Let me warn you, these are <strong>very loud birds</strong>! Aside from mimicking pretty much any sound they like to copy, scarlet macaws make a variety of low-pitched sounds including squawks, screeches and screams that can carry for up to a couple of miles (even your avian vet will hear Polly's screams a couple of miles out). Out in the wild, these vocalization helps them to make their presence known, call to their groups and locating potential mates.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Care and Feeding</strong><br><br> </h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Like all birds, the scarlet macaw will flourish in an environment where they can freely move and roam around, and <strong><a href="https://amzn.to/2M717ei" target="_blank" title="4 Level Bird Ferret Parrot Cage Aviary Cat Budgie Hamster House W Castor" rel="noopener noreferrer">will suffer in a cage that’s too small for its size</a>.</strong><br><br>This bird is known for <strong>self-mutilation when confined</strong> (not like the Japanese hara-kiri, but <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/birds-being-you-know-birds" title="Birds Being... You now "><strong>more on plucking away their own feathers</strong></a>, just imagine how painful is that for a bird), and will not do well with an owner who confines him on his cage pretty much all the time and has no plan of letting him go out for a sufficient out-of-cage time.<br><br><strong>Large bird swings</strong> and <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cages/products/large-house-proof-birdcage-with-chew-toys-accessories-1" title="LARGE HOUSE-PROOF BIRDCAGE WITH CHEW TOYS &amp; ACCESSORIES"><strong>bird toys inside his bird cage</strong></a> or <strong>bird aviary</strong> are a necessary, too, because the scarlet macaw is <strong>an active bird that needs stimulation for both his mind and body</strong>, like playing and chewing on anything that he finds interesting.
