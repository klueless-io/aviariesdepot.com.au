<p>(<span style="color: #9900ff;">Pretty much anything about the Mini Macaws</span>)</p> <p>Mini Macaws are like large Macaws... but obviously they are much smaller, easier to care for, and <strong>tend to be better talkers</strong>! These small Macaws are called <strong>Mini Macaws</strong> and just like their other larger cousins, they are also curious, playful and full of guts (And of course they are most likely adorable too). They are also very intelligent and trainable, which makes them a very enjoyable pet.</p> <p>If you want a Macaw, but are a bit taken aback by the enormous size and the powerful beak of a full sized Macaw, the Mini Macaw is perfect for you. They<strong> take up less space and are easier to care for</strong>. They are also quite comical and can also be better at mimicking human speech. The life span of the Mini Macaw is shorter however, on the average they will live about 20 - 30 years. (30 to 20 years is a fairly lengthy time if you think about it).</p> <p>A smaller version of the <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw" title="The Red Talker of the Amazon - The Scarlett Macaw"><strong>large Macaw</strong></a>, Mini Macaws are very charismatic and energetic. They are not so big or vividly colored but like their larger relatives, they are avid chewers and can be very loud too. They also need lots of room with plenty of activities and playthings such as bird toys. The Mini Macaws can make wonderful pet birds if well socialized when young. Depending on the species however, some will easily retain their amiable personalities than others.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Mini Macaws as Pets</strong></h2> <p>(<span style="color: #9900ff;">They may be small but these Birds sure are a handful</span>)</p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/mini-macaws-as-pets-390844" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-mini-macaws-full-macaw-personality-in-a-small-package-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>If you'd like to have a mini macaw for a pet, you should know that the only small thing about these parrots is their size. Personality literally oozes out of these birds, so <strong>potential owners need the right stuff to be able to keep up with these little guys</strong>.<br><br>Mini macaws <strong>need lots of interaction from their owner, along with plenty of toys and an abundance of space.</strong> These intelligent parrots easily bond with their owner and can be depended upon to eventually mimic what you say and movements you make. Getting a Mini Macaw as <strong>a pet is a big lifestyle commitment and shouldn't be taken lightly</strong>.<br><br>Plus they usually live quite a long time for a bird, so that's a significant commitment. They also <strong>require a proper aviary if kept outdoors</strong>, or a <strong>good sized cage when kept indoors</strong> with regular outside playtime for exercise and to prevent boredom. That means regular interaction and <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-toys" title="bird chew toys"><strong>lots of soft chew toys</strong></a>. The length of their lives, along with their necessary bird care, means keeping a pet Mini Macaw requires a substantial investment of time, money, and space. Find out all you need to know about mini macaws -- the species, how to care for them and what it takes to be a good mini macaw owner. <br><br></p> <h2><strong><span style="color: #b45f06;">Did You Know That…</span></strong></h2> <p>(<span style="color: #9900ff;">Facts about Mini Macaws</span>)<br><br><br></p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">The Mini Macaws are the smallest Macaw species. (obviously)</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are <strong>eight types of Mini Macaws</strong> in a range of sizes from about 12 inches (30 cm) to about 20 inches (50 cm) in total length.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">The actual Mini Macaw lifespan is about 20-30 years in a good environment.</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">An important question, that is often misconstrued, is how long do Macaws live. The answer is rather surprising when considering they are some of the larger parrots. The actual Mini Macaw lifespan is between about 20-30 years in a good environment. The average lifespan of their larger counterparts, both large Macaws and large hybrids, is between about 35-50. These parrots are easily outlived by the cockatoos, and by medium sized parrots like the Amazons.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">There are several species of Mini Macaws that are commonly available as pets.</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #0c343d;"><strong>These are:</strong></span></div> <em><em><br></em></em> <ul> <ul> <li> <em>Araauricollis</em> (yellow collared), </li> <li> <em>Arasevera, Diopsitticanobilis</em> (red shouldered), </li> <li> <em>Aranobilisnobilis</em> and </li> <li> <em>Aranobiliscumanensis</em>. </li> </ul> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 60px;">Each one is different from the other and has different color combinations in its plumage. <br><br>Less common Mini Macaws include: <br><br></p> <ul> <ul> <li> <em>AramaracanaIlliger’s</em>, <em>Aramanilata</em> (red-bellied) and </li> <li> <em>Aracouloni (</em>blue headed). </li> </ul> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><br>However, none of these are very appropriate pets for various reasons.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Mini Macaws are active, curious and intelligent.</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">When left to their own devices you’ll see them hanging, climbing and swinging on whatever bird toys may be available to them. They simply love playing with almost anything imaginable, so you’ll have an unending variety of<strong> items available to you to use as bird toys</strong>, without even having to buy any from the pet shop. Checking online is a good start if you are searching for a <strong>suitable toy</strong>, such as these ones on <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au</a>.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Mini Macaws loves Bath.</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">They also generally love bathing and seem to quite enjoy taking a shower with their humans – (provided the water isn’t scorching hot of course!) If you don’t want to share your shower you should definitely make sure to give those baths regularly or just buy them their very own <strong>Bird Bath</strong> (like this one: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"SPI Home 33562 Curious Cat and Bird Birdbath\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":21161,"3":[null,0],"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"10":2,"12":0,"15":"arial,sans,sans-serif","17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2M52fPs" title="SPI Home 33562 Curious Cat and Bird Birdbath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SPI Home 33562 Curious Cat and Bird Birdbath</strong></a> on Amazon) </span> . Otherwise <strong>they’ll use their water bowls and do it themselves</strong>. </p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Different Species of Mini Macaws</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;">(<span style="color: #9900ff;">Don’t be confused, we might look the same, but try to look closer..</span>)</p> <h3></h3> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Severe or Chestnut-fronted Macaw</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right; padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-mini-macaws-full-macaw-personality-in-a-small-package-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">They are the <strong>largest specie of Mini Macaws</strong>. Some authorities include these macaws in the group of "large macaws"; however, since their body length is 20 inches (50 cm) or less, this species meets the size requirement of mini-macaws.<br><br>They are about the <strong>same size as <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/the-african-grey-parrot" title="african grey parrot">African Greys</a></strong>, but have a more slender body structure. They are said to bond quickly with their new owners and respond quickly to training, but need adequate socialization to remain friendly.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Hahn's / Red-shouldered or Noble (Mini) Macaws</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="float: left; padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-mini-macaws-full-macaw-personality-in-a-small-package-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">They look a lot like a <strong>Blue Crown Conure with a red patch on their shoulder</strong>. They are generally green with blue on their forehead, a white bare patch around their eyes and a dark gray beak. At 12 inches long, the Hahn's macaw was <strong>entitles as the smallest of all true macaws</strong>.<br><br>Intelligent, charming and easy to care for, Hahn's macaws have recently exploded in popularity as pets. One look at these little guys says it all, Hahn's macaws are adorable.The Noble Macaw looks and acts the same as the Hahn’s accept the upper mandible is orange-yellow colored. </p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Illiger's Macaws</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="float: right; padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-mini-macaws-full-macaw-personality-in-a-small-package-4.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">They are playful, friendly birds that enjoy human interaction so much. When hand-fed as babies and raised in loving, attentive homes, these intelligent birds bond strongly with their owners and quickly respond to positive training techniques.<br><br>They <strong>require a lot of mental stimulation</strong> and they like to stay busy, so an Illiger's macaw is <strong>not for owners that don't have plenty of time to spend with their pets</strong>. They are small, around 16-17", Their plumage is mostly green with the forehead and sides of abdomen and lower back orange-red to red.<br><br>The crown is blue; the head, nape, and cheeks are greenish-blue; the wings are blue with blue primary-coverts and bluish-green edges; and the under wing-coverts olive-green. The tail feathers are blue with reddish-brown tips and olive-yellow underside.<br><br>Females have less red coloration than males. Their typical Macaw naked facial patch is lightly striped with very fine feather lines, and the iris is orange-brown. The bill is black and Illiger's Macaws have flesh colored legs.<br><br>Immature Illiger's Macaws have paler plumage than adults, less red on the forehead, and horn colored edges to the bill. They are a medium noisy bird with a loud shrill call that some people cannot take. They do best in a multi-bird household if the owner will not be able to spend a good deal of time with them. (Please keep in mind that they live 50-60 years.)</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Yellow-Collared Macaws</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="float: left; padding-left: 30px;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-mini-macaws-full-macaw-personality-in-a-small-package-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><strong>Affectionate, but somewhat mischievous</strong>, the 15-inch long yellow-collared macaw has a reputation for being an intelligent and resourceful little parrot. They thrive on attention from their owners, and like other macaws will seek that attention by any means necessary.<br><br>Many yellow-collared macaws are little escape artists, so steps should be taken to <a href="https://amzn.to/2JIXLfe" target="_blank" title="Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand-alone Budgie Perch Castor Wheel" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>provide a cage that is safe and secure</strong></a>.

However, because of the increasing pressure on their <strong>native habitats</strong> and decreased populations, Mini Macaws are at risk in the wild. Fortunately there are many devoted breeders of the favored Mini Macaw species, so they will likely continue to be regularly bred and available.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Caring, Breeding, and Conservation</strong></h3> <p>Conservation of Mini Macaws has become vastly important in the fight to preserve endangered birds. Captive breeding, care, and good management of captive birds are part of this. Through the dedicated efforts of aviculturists a strong, self-sustaining population of these endangered birds is available in captivity. It is because of the efforts of these people that some of the Mini Macaws, Large Macaws included, will survive extinction, and/or will be available for re-introduction into their natural habitats. These efforts have already allowed for some species to be re-introduced to their native homes, though this is still in the experimental stages.

All Macaw species have diminished Populations declining in the wild has affected all types of Macaws, and all Macaw species are now considered endangered birds, vulnerable, or of concern. Currently there are no populations considered stable enough to not be considered at risk or endangered <br><br> Currently the IUNC Red List of Threatened Species shows that the majority of the Mini Macaw species are faring better than their larger cousins. Four species are listed as Least Concern (LC), 1 species as Vulnerable (VU), and 1 species as Near Threatened (NT). Thankfully, none of these Mini Macaws are listed as Endangered (EN) or Critically Endangered (CR).

Fortunately there are devoted breeders of Mini Macaw species which helps in the continuing effort to preserve the species and making them available as pets. The Yellow-collard Macaw and the Hahn's Macaw are the most popular in the pet trade, followed by the Severe Macaw and the Illiger's Macaw. The Noble Macaw and Blue-headed Macaw, though available, are rarer. The only Mini Macaw that is not really found in the pet trade is the Red-Bellied Macaw. Though at one time it was a common import, it is no longer available. This species has a highly specialized diet and is incredibly difficult to breed, so is now extremely rare in captivity.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-mini-macaws-full-macaw-personality-in-a-small-package-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>No matter what species of Mini Macaws you have, (or just planning to have) always remember that their health, happiness and their well-being.
