<p>Lovebirds are <strong>awesome pocket-sized</strong> pet birds full off character. They have the <strong>charisma</strong> of a full-sized parrot packed in a <strong>pint-size package</strong>. Lovebirds are <strong>mini jesters</strong>, playing for pretty much all the time they are awake. They love to hang around the house, swing around on where they perch like a trapeze artist, and sometimes dance on your shoulder or peck you while sitting on top of your head. They have that <strong>penchant of pecking</strong> and hiding little things that piques their interest, such as your jewelry, the buttons on your shirts, or everything intriguing and small enough for their tiny beaks to lift up and carry. More about your feathered friends at <a href="https://www.beautyofbirds.com/lovebirdpets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bird Breeds</a>.</p> <p>Despite their diminutive size, they are <strong>very active</strong> and pretty much anything they do will always get your attention. They are also know to be <strong>very cheerful</strong> and it is evident on their face and of course, in their actions. They have that aura in them that <strong>radiate happiness and joy to your home</strong> and to everyone else around.</p> <p><strong>Curiosity</strong> is one of their <strong>distinguishable trait</strong>, to the point that they <strong>act like toddlers</strong> on a playground.

When there isn't anything interesting around, they tend to get bored and are likely to chew on any clothing and jewelry that happened to be around, and pull off buttons.</p> <p>To keep them busy and away from things they tend to destroy, you need to<strong> give them enough attention</strong> or <strong>get another Lovebird of the opposite sex</strong> as their mating partner and playmate.</p> <p>Lovebirds is the common name of <strong>Agapornis</strong>, from the <strong>Greek word agape</strong>, which means love, and ornis, which means bird.

Sometimes, other lovebird got their companionship from other sources like bonding with other pet birds (not of the lovebird variety) and other pets such as dogs, guinea pigs, rabbits and hamsters. And never ever introduce your lovebird to your pet cat who is not used to be with birds, or else, your bird will become your cat's tasty meal. And also, nobody expects them to bond with pet fishes right?<br><br></p> <h2><strong>Planning To Get One...</strong></h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/meet-the-lovebirds-and-its-other-genera-10.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">If you planning to buy a pair of lovebirds, then it is natural that they will bond with each other and will look very cute snuggled up to each other's company. But since they have each other they might not bond well with you.<br><br>If you buy only one lovebird then you will have to give him or her just as much attention as another lovebird would give (that doesn't mean spending 24 hours a day 7 days a week tending to your pet and satisfying its attention cravings)<br><br>Having one lovebird means you will have to <strong>let him or her out of the cage and play</strong> with her to keep her entertained. You will find that your lovebird will want to cuddle and chirp at you because he or she loves you and recognizes you as his or her mate.<br>See also: <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet" title="shall i get a bird as a pet"><strong>Shall I Get a Bird as a Pet</strong></a><br><br></p> <h2><strong>A Little Reminder...<br><br></strong></h2> <p>It is important to have a <strong>large bird cage </strong>﻿(see: <span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand-alone Budgie Perch Castor Wheels Large 140cm\t"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'><a href="https://amzn.to/2JIXLfe" target="_blank" title="large bird cage" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand</a>-amazon)</span> for your lovebird couple with basic <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cage-accessories" title="bird cage accessories"><strong>bird cage accessories</strong></a> such as a <strong>small bird swing set</strong>, a <strong>bird platform/perch</strong> or a <strong>simple bird hammock swing</strong> just like the ones available on online pet stores like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au</a>, for they tend to be very active and inquisitive and will continue to play inside their cage after a long playtime outside.
