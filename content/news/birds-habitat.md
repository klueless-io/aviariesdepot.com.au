<p>Habitat is a <strong>natural environment</strong> in which a bird lives, including all associated plant life, land forms, climate and other wildlife. Different species of birds suit different types of natural habitat. Although there is much overlap in the resources that different habitats provide (e.g. insect food), some habitats are rich in certain resources.</p> <p>A habitat includes all four necessities for a <strong>bird's survival</strong> – <strong>food, water, shelter and nesting areas</strong> though these features can vary greatly between different type’s habitats. </p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Food:</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Grains, seeds, fruits, nuts, nectar-producing flowers and prey such as insects, fish, mammals, reptiles and other birds.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Water:</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Any source available for drinking or bathing, including rivers, swamps, lakes, streams, bays, estuaries and oceans.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Shelter:</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/meaning-of-coniferous-385201" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coniferous</a> or deciduous trees, shrubbery, caves or rock niches, overhanging banks or snags. </p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Nesting Sites:</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Hollow trees or snags, vegetation to support nests, burrows, nesting boxes, bird houses and suitable <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/attract-birds-with-nesting-material-386423" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nesting material</a>..

Food and water are absolute basics, but so is shelter or cover to serve as protection from the weather and a safe place to raise a family.<strong><br><br></strong>Many <strong>backyard birds are insect eaters</strong>, but will supplement their diet with nuts, seeds, fruit, or nectar, depending on the species. Increase the array of foods you offer, and you will increase the diversity of birds you will attract and support.

By providing a clean, fresh source, you will attract more species than will visit bird feeders<br><br></p> <h4> <span style="color: #e69138;"><strong>Supplemental Sources:</strong></span><br><br> </h4> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Ponds &amp; Water Gardens</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The creation of these water elements will take some work but, done well, they can attract many species. Ponds for birds should be shallow, with gently sloping shorelines.</p> <ul> <li><span style="font-size: 15px;"><a href="https://amzn.to/2M52fPs%EF%BB%BF" target="_blank" title="SPI Home 33562 Curious Cat and Bird Birdbath" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Bird Baths</strong></span></a></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">The sides should incline gently to a depth of no more than two to three inches. The surface should be rough for better footing. To protect vulnerable bathing birds from lurking predators, locate the bath some distance from cover, about 15 feet is a good distance. Change the water every few days and keep the bath scrubbed clean. Birds are attracted to the sound of running water and a drip or misting feature will increase the number of visitors.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Shelter</strong></span></li> </ul> <ul></ul> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-habitat-3.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Birds need places where they can hide from predators and inclement weather. Trees, shrubs, meadows, and even rock walls provide such shelter.</p> <h3></h3> <h3><strong>Supplemental sources</strong></h3> <ul></ul> <p>Create a brush pile from fallen branches and leaves. Or toss your discarded Christmas tree a few feet away from the <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-feeders" title="bird feeders"><strong>feeder</strong></a>, far enough so that a lurking cat can’t pounce from behind it onto a ground-feeding bird but close enough for the birds to find speedy cover. A dry stone wall, with its nooks and crannies, or simply small piles of rocks can also provide hiding spots, as can a pile of logs. You can also erect boxes designed specifically for roosting, with the entrance hole near the bottom so that heat doesn’t escape. Mount the box in a sheltered area, preferably facing south.</p> <h3></h3> <h2>Nesting</h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-habitat-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">A major feature of birds is that they lay eggs, and for the vast majority of species this involves building a nest.<br><br>Three important elements of the design of most nests are that they are robust, provide good insulation and are well camouflaged.<br><br>Sticks, bark and grass commonly provide the support structure, and these items are usually abundant.<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Nesting sites</strong></h3> <p>Most eggs that are produced by birds are eaten by predators (typically 70%) so there is a high demand for concealed nest sites. Many small birds nest in the understory where the vegetation is often thickest.</p> <p>Some species also show a preference for nesting in spiky shrubs, and several examples are listed in the Gardening section. Some species, notably parrots, nest in tree hollows, so old (greater than 100 years) gum trees which have started to form hollows are particularly valuable resources for birds (as well as native mammals).<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Natural Habitats of Birds</strong></h3> <p><strong>Different species of birds suit different types of natural habitat</strong>. Although there is much overlap in the resources that different habitats provide (e.g. insect food), some habitats are rich in certain resources.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Some Birds Habitats</strong></h2> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Heathland</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heathlands usually occur on <strong>infertile soils</strong>. Around <strong>Sydney</strong>, they are <strong>primarily found near the coast</strong> where they are subject to wind and salt spray. Heathlands do not support tall trees: most heathland plants are <strong>less than two meters tall.</strong></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Heathlands are <strong>very dense habitats</strong> and because most heathland plants are <strong>hard-leaved</strong>, they form a prickly structure that provides good shelter for small birds. Many heathland plants (e.g. banksias) belong to the plant family Proteaceae, and the flowers of these species are often rich in nectar.</p> <ul> <li><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Woodland</strong></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Woodlands are a <strong>habitat type dominated by trees</strong>, but with a relatively low canopy cover of less than 30%. E<span>ucalypts</span> dominate the canopy and the under story is relatively open, often containing native grasses. In the Sydney Basin, woodlands used to be common in the western parts which have more fertile soils. However, most of this habitat type has now been cleared, first for farmland, and more recently for housing.<br><br></p> <h1 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Forest</strong></h1> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-habitat-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Includes boreal regions, temperate woodlands and tropical jungles </p> <p><strong>Forests are a habitat dominated by trees</strong>, with a canopy cover of between 30 % and 50 %. There are <strong>two main types of forest in Australia</strong>, both of which are dominated by eucalypts.</p> <h3>Wet-sclerophyll</h3> <p>forests have a canopy that is taller than 30 metres and generally have a soft-leaved understorey, often including tree ferns.</p> <h3>Dry-sclerophyll</h3> <p>forests have a canopy between 10 metres and 30 metres tall, and generally have a hard-leaved understorey with wattles, peas and boronias.</p> <h3>Rainforest</h3> <p>Rainforests grow on deeper, more fertile soils with moister soil conditions. They have a canopy greater than 30 m in height which is relatively closed (greater than 70 % canopy cover). Rainforests around Sydney often include some eucalypts in the canopy but also have species such as figs, red cedar and cabbage-tree palms.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Other Habitats Are The Following:</strong><br><br> </h2> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Wetland</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Includes marshes, bogs and swamps<strong> .</strong>Wetlands are low lying areas that are at least periodically inundated with water. There are both freshwater and saline wetlands around Sydney that provide habitat for a range of species that are not present in other habitats.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Coastal</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Coastal habitats include beaches, headlands, estuaries and rock platforms that are home to many species of sea bird in Australia.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Grassland</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Includes meadows, prairies, plains and scrub regions</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Dessert</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">With varying degrees of aridity and drought-tolerant vegetation</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Tundra</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Circumpolar regions with light and temperature extremes</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Oceans</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/pelagic-definition-seabirds-386849" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pelagic</a> zones that include offshore islands and aquatic regions</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #38761d; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Urban and Suburban</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> Regions associated with humans, including major cities<br><br></p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How Habitat Loss Affects Birds</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-habitat-6.png" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Many birds are <strong>threatened by habitat destruction and fragmentation</strong> that <strong>eliminates the necessary undisturbed environments</strong>. Developmental activities that most impact habitat include:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"> </p> <ul> <li> <strong>Agricultural use</strong>, including clearing habitats for fields or grazing livestock.</li> <li> <strong>Logging and forest harvesting</strong> that removes mature vegetation.</li> <li> <strong>Expansion of urban areas</strong> for housing, industry or similar developments.</li> <li> <strong>Infrastructure development</strong> that fractures habitats, such as roads, electrical lines, wind turbines or similar structures.<br><br><br><br> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <h2> <strong>How To Conserve Birds Habitat</strong><br><br> </h2> <p><strong>Habitat conservation</strong> is the single best step anyone can take to help protect birds, and fortunately it is also one of the easiest.<br><br><br></p> <h3></h3> <h3>First Do No Harm</h3> <p>The easiest way to provide safe habitat for birds is to protect the habitats birds already use. <strong>Protection, preservation, conservation</strong> – they all mean the same thing, <strong>keeping habitat in good shape to meet the needs of wildlife</strong>. For birds, that means habitat must be able to provide nutritious food, clean water, safe shelter and secure nesting sites<br><br></p> <h3>Preserve Personal Habitat:</h3> <p>Minimizing pruning or cutting down trees, avoiding excessive chemical use, leaving leaf litter intact and allowing snags to stand are all easy ways to keep a backyard habitat productive for birds.<br><br></p> <h3>Live a "Green" Lifestyle<br><br><strong> </strong> </h3> <p>Choosing a low-emission vehicle, reducing water and electricity use, minimizing your carbon footprint, recycling regularly, carpooling and other common sense steps all help protect habitat that birds and wildlife need.<br><br></p> <h3>Dispose of Chemicals Properly<br><br> </h3> <p>Chemicals such as <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-pest-control-hurts-birds-386321" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pesticides</a> and herbicides should always be used responsibly, not overused in ways that may contribute to excessive run off in the environment. Other potential contaminants such as motor oil, soaps and medications should be disposed of safely so they cannot affect habitat and wildlife.<br><br></p> <h3>Respect Habitat<br><br> </h3> <p>This means staying on marked trails so delicate plants are not crushed, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/how-litter-hurts-birds-386484" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">picking up all litter</a> and not fiddling with new buds or growth on nearby trees or shrubs. Flowers should be allowed to bloom rather than be picked, and pets and children should be carefully supervised so they do not accidentally damage habitat.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"></h2> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ways To Conserve Birds</strong></h2> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-habitat-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></h3> <h3></h3> <h3>Prevent Bird Collisions with Your Windows</h3> <p>Birds see nature reflected in the window or mistake houseplants inside the building for outdoor plants and fly into the glass. Putting up curtains or window decals helps make the window visible to birds. Protect Birds from Pets Unleashed dogs and outdoor cats can harm birds by disturbing, chasing, and even killing them.<br><br><br></p> <h3>Clean Your Bird Feeders<strong> <br></strong> </h3> <p><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/health-implication-of-bird-feeders" title="Health Implications of Bird Feeders "><strong>Dirty feeders can spread disease</strong></a>.
