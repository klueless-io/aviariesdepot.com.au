<p>The Princess Parrot is an <strong>Australian parrot with the scientific name of Polytelis alexandrae</strong>. That is because it was named in honour of Princess Alexandra of Denmark (1844-1925). Princess Alexandra married Edward, Prince of Wales and when he became King Edward VII of Great Britain on 22nd January, 1901, she became Queen.This lovely bird is known by a variety of names, including Alexandra's Parrot, Princess of Wales Parakeet, Princess Alexandra's Parrot, Queen Alexandra Parakeet, Rose-throated Parrakeet and Spinifex Parrot. <br><br> We’ve seen them in the wild in the inland desert areas of South Australia, but some believe they are also found in Western Australia in both desert and mountain areas. They are nomadic and fly together in groups and can often be found - and heard - near waterholes and other sources of water.</p> <p>Of course, there are both male and female Princess Parrots, but they are all called princesses! One of the first things noticeable about these parrots at a distance is their piercing calls. They make good, <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet" title="Shall I Get A Bird As A Pet"><strong>gentle pets </strong></a>and even seem to be affectionate, but <strong>their call when they are indoors and decide they require attention can be deafening.</strong></p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Princess Parrot Profile: <br></strong></h2> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></h3> <h3>Origin:</h3> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Australia</p> <h3>Class:</h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Aves</div> <ul></ul> <h3>Order: </h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Psittaciformes (Parrots)</div> <ul></ul> <h3>Family: </h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Psittaculidae (true parrot family)</div> <ul></ul> <h3>Subfamily: </h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Psittaculinae</div> <ul></ul> <h3>Genus:</h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Polytelis</div> <ul></ul> <h3>Length:<strong><br></strong> </h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">The male grows to about 46 cm (16 inches) long; the female is a little shorter.</div> <ul></ul> <h3>Weight:</h3> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">These birds are surprisingly light as the biggest males only weigh about 120 g (4 and a quarter ounces)<br><br><br><br> </div> <ul></ul> <h2><strong>Male</strong></h2> <p><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">The nape of the head is blue, while the back of the head and neck appear to have a greyish olive green colour. The back and outer tail feathers are a almost yellowish olive colouration, where the majority back parts of the wings are a stunning light although bright green. The outer flights are typically a mix with bluish, grey with a hint of green merged into one colour.<br><br>The rump has a beautiful dark purplish blue colouration that extend half way up to the back. The throat region is a dark pink, while the chest and body parts are a light green. The under sides of the tail feathers are pinkish, with the feet a brownish colour and the nails being black. The beak is a dark orangeish red colour, while the eyes have a orange iris and black pupils.<br><br><br></p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Female<br></strong></h2> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> <p><br>Very similar to the male, except the hen does not contain the extra long tail feathers, nor does it contain the lobes on the flight feather when mature. <br><br>The hens beak is usually slightly less paler in colour, and does not contain the bright orange iris and the full amounts of blue on the nape of the head. The back of the rump colouring is slightly less darker in blue.<br><br><br><br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h2></h2> <h2><strong>Young Birds</strong></h2> <strong>Young Princess Parrots look very similar to the hens</strong>, although they have a black eye colour. This eye colour will change once the bird matures. Young males will get there lobes around the ages of 1.5 to 2 years. At this age the males will be sexually mature, with full feather plumage and ready to breed. Extra plumage colouration especially the blue on the nape of the head. A darker blue on the back of the rump, orange iris colouring and the brighter green patch will also be seen at this time.<br><br> <ul></ul> <h2><strong>Beak and Eyes</strong></h2> <p>As you can see in the top and bottom photographs, the male's beak is a coral red and his eyes have orange irises; the female's beak is paler and her irises are brown.</p> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <h2><strong>Procreation</strong></h2> <p>Princess Parrots are believed to be <strong>monogamous as most parrots are</strong>, but there is no specific information for the species. These are opportunistic breeders, <strong>they will mate when food is plentiful rather than in a specific season</strong>. Their preferred nesting site is generally in the hollow of a eucalyptus or desert oak tree.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Breeding season lasts from September to December. The birds then go through the moult from late December until March.The female lays 4 to 6 eggs which are incubated for 19 days. Juveniles leave the nest at around 5 weeks after hatching</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Temperament<br></strong></h2> In the wild these are nomadic birds which live in small groups. As pets they’re regarded as one of the easier species to care for and have a pleasant, affectionate nature. <br><br><br> <ul></ul> <h2><strong>Talkativeness</strong></h2> Princess Parrots can be trained to talk, they’re generally regarded as <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/hear-our-voices" title="Hear Our Voices "><strong>moderate talkers and excellent whistlers.</strong></a><br><br><br> <ul></ul> <h2><strong>Environment</strong></h2> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> <p>One feature of this parrot is their exceptionally long tail.

If this requirement is not adequately met, the birds’ constant jumping may damage the eggs.

Princess parrots are characterized by a <strong>certain clumsiness and most breeders prefer avoiding this type of box</strong>. A <strong>typical nest box</strong> would house at least <strong>2-3 adult birds</strong>. This allows an adequate breathing room for fully fledged parrots, while simultaneously leaving enough free space for fledglings to grow.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>High parallel box dimensions: height 600 cm, width 40 cm, depth 40 cm.<br>“L” shaped boxes are of medium-sized dimensions: height 600 cm, width 40 cm, depth 600 cm. <br><br>The level below the <strong>door can come with a flap</strong> for easy inspections. <br><br>“U” shaped boxes are approximately 600 cm in height, 800 cm in width and 40 cm in depth.</p> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <h3><strong>Exercise</strong></h3> <p>Princess parrots require constant exercise in order to stay healthy and entertained. Lack of interaction and attention may lead to behavioral problems, such as <strong>screaming and feather plucking</strong>. The animal should be allowed to spend <em>3-4 hours</em> a day outside of its cage to exercise and stretch the muscles. This cage-free period should always be closely supervised to prevent any unwanted consequences.

For more amazing bird toys and bird cages and accessories, check it out on online store like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au</a>. Natural wood and calcium <span style="color: #e69138;"><strong>perches</strong></span> are also recommended to satisfy the bird’s chewing habits, while the latter will also supply the animal with all needed minerals. Toys and perches should be regularly rearranged inside the cage to keep the Princess parrot active. The owner should consider spending at least two hours a day together with the pet.</p> <p> </p> <ul></ul> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>How To Train A Princess Parrot:</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-9.png" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>It usually takes several days for the bird to adjust to a new environment and become familiar and comfortable with the new setting and people. <strong>Early socialization</strong> with each and every family member is key in <strong>preventing future destructive </strong><b>behavior</b>, such as excessive screaming, biting and feather plucking. <br><br> The Princess parrot is an <strong>intelligent animal</strong> that is eager for attention. As a result, training should begin from the moment the bird becomes accustomed to the new environment. One should provide the pet with several days for the latter to become attuned to one’s appearance, voice and to its own cage before moving on to the handling process. <strong>In general, it is easier for an owner to handle a hand-fed baby than a fully fledged parrot</strong>.</p> <ul></ul> <p>Training involves a <strong>repetitive routine</strong>, which should be divided into several 10-15 minute sessions. One should always start with simple words and sentences, for example “Hello”and “Good morning”. Depending on their meaning, said words should be pronounced with a corresponding intonation. The bird will thus be able to logically connect each word or phrase with its individual response, which will in turn lead to a more enjoyable learning experience for both pet and owner.</p> <p>Parrots may learn to pronounce words in a more natural-sounding voice that would differ from the usual high-pitched noises. Lessons should begin as soon as the bird is relaxed.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Controlling Destructive Behaviour</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-10.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>One should feel completely relaxed during training sessions. Parrots are able to understand when someone is nervous or afraid of them. In response, the animals will grow nervous themselves and will attempt to bite out of self-defense.</p> <ul></ul> One should closely examine the bird’s behaviour to determine the reasons behind the pet’s willingness to bite. For example, <strong>some parrots bite out of fear, however other triggers are possible as well.</strong><br> <ul></ul> Should the parrot express its need for attention through inappropriate behaviour, one should temporarily move to an adjacent room.<br> <ul></ul> Should the pet become nervous in the presence of its owner, the latter should issue a “No bite” or a similar command and touch the bird’s beak.<br> <ul></ul> A successful handling process is founded on repetition. Thus, one should always strive towards issuing the same commands and showcasing the same behaviour.<br> <ul></ul> One should never resort to physical abuse, regardless of the extent of the parrot’s biting behaviour. Other than being inefficient, this method will also lead to the animal developing a fear of people.<br> <ul></ul> The parrot’s screams should be ignored at all times. This task will require patience, however ignoring attention-seeking behaviour is an optimal way of breaking the pet’s bad habit of excessive screaming. One should always be prepared for loud, shrieking noises. Similar to any child’s behaviour, the Princess will produce high decibel screams in order to attract the owner’s attention.<br> <ul></ul> <p>Should such behaviour become evident, the owner should promptly leave the room and return only once the parrot has remained silent for at least <em>10 seconds</em>. The owner is then recommended to provide the bird with the needed attention. Over time, this will teach the animal that desirable behaviour will always be rewarded.<br><br></p> <h3><strong>Bonding</strong></h3> <div style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-11.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></div> It is essential for the owner to bond with the pet in order to establish a long-lasting and successful relationship. The strength of the bond will have a direct effect on the quality of the pet’s life, as well as on the owner’s personal experience. One should teach the Princess parrot all basic household rules and regularly tend after the animal’s needs.<br><br>Special attention should be paid to the socialization aspect of training. For instance, should the pet become nervous around one’s presence, the latter should devote 5-10 minutes a day conversing with the bird from a close distance. However, the owner should be careful not to make any sudden movements around the bird and to speak in a friendly and cheerful manner.<br><br><br><br> <h3><strong>Taming</strong></h3> <div style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/the-princess-parrot-12.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></div> The taming method involves <strong>figuring out the parrot’s comfort zone</strong>, slightly crossing its borders, dealing with the caused discomfort and then rewarding the parrot with treats. To initiate the process, one should first come in direct contact with the parrot.<br><br>The safest approach would be to start from the beak – one should place one’s hand in front of the parrot and move it in a slow, non-threatening manner. Should the parrot attempt to bite, the owner should stop and wait for several seconds until the bird is no longer nervous.<br> <ul></ul> <h3> <br><br><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Did You Know:</strong></span> </h3> <p>The princess parrot is <strong>fully protected by law from capture and is registered as an endangered species</strong>. In the wild, princess parrots are surprisingly tame and easy to approach. If alarmed, they will fly off a short distance and resettle nearby.</p> <p> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
