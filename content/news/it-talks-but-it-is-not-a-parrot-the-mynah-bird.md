Although mynah’s can learn new words until about the age of two, your mynah is the most impressionable between the ages of three and nine months. <br><br>Just like any <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/why-birds-make-great-pets" title="Why Birds Make Great Pets "><strong>other bird you can get as a pet</strong></a>, Mynah birds have also their unique characteristics and charm those owners will really love.
