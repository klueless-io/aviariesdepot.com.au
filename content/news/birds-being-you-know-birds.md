<p>Just like other pets such as cats and dogs, Birds also have some<strong> behavioral problems</strong> which their owners and caretakers find difficult to deal with. There are also times where they misbehave and end up frustrating their owner (also makes them rip their hair off their heads, like literally!), but get this, a few of these behavioral issues have rather simple solutions if the bird owner would just pay a little more attention, time and a lot of effort.</p> <p>Here are some common things your birdie will do and also the reasons behind it (plus the things that you can do about it):</p> <ul> <li>Flashing/dilating pupils</li> <li>Barking</li> <li>Growling/Purring</li> <li>Tongue clicking</li> <li>Biting</li> <li>Whistling, Talking, singing</li> <li>Feather plucking</li> <li>Destructive behavior</li> <li>Screaming</li> </ul> <h2></h2> <h2><strong>Dead Fish Eyes</strong></h2> <p>(Why do your birdie have a flashing/dilating eyes)</p> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-being-you-know-birds-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">When your pet birds dilate or flash their eyes, it can be a <strong>sign of aggression</strong>, <strong>excitement, nervousness, or pleasure</strong> (or a combination of both or all). That flashing of a bird’s eyes is also called “<strong>pinning</strong>”. There are certain reasons for this particular behavior. When a bird is displaying an <strong>aggressive behavior</strong> such as tail fanning, this means “back off” or "one more freaking in closer and ill flay you!”. <br><br>So, you better not approach your pet bird when it exhibits this kind of behavior you might get a nasty bite (which of course, you deserve, haven't I warned you earlier?). This can also be a response to other animals, another bird or human that is not welcome in the area.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Hon, Who’s Dog Is That?</strong></h2> <p>(Hey! you’re a bird, so what's with the barking?)</p> <p>Dogs aren’t just the only pets that bark, sometimes <strong>pet birds does it too</strong>. Birds also “bark” when they are <strong>excited</strong>, and if they are having a chatting session. This is also a display of dominance over their cage mates or to other birds in the household.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Growling and Purring</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: center;">(They might sound the same but actually they really aren't)</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-being-you-know-birds-2.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Just like any other animals, <strong>growling</strong> is also a form of <strong>aggression</strong> in birds. It indicates that the bird does not want to bother and it is also sometimes accompanied by flashing or dilating of the pupils and rising of the feathers in the back neck area. <br><br>In these cases, it is wise to stay away from them and just wait until your pet bird calm down before attempting to approach. Purring on the other hand sounds very similar to the growling sound, but it’s no accompanied by the dilating of pupils. This means the exact opposite of growling which means that the bird is relaxed and their feathers are fluffed up. It indicates contentment.<br><br><br></p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>*Click*…*Click*…*Click*</strong></h2> <p>(At first you bark, then now that?)</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-being-you-know-birds-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Pet birds love to make fascinating sounds which feels like relaxing music the ears, and you might also notice that they do some weird ones too (such as <strong>tongue clicking</strong>). Rapid “clicking” of the tongue against their beak is a <strong>positive and friendly behavior </strong>they usually do. This generally means that your pet bird is feeling friendly towards you and informing you that if you approach them this time, they won’t try to hurt or bite your finger out. This positive behavior is most likely seen with <strong>Cockatoos</strong>.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <br><br>Ouch...Birdie That Hurts!</h2> <p>(Nasty Bird Bites)</p> <p><strong>Biting</strong> is one of the most reported cases of problematic behavior that pet birds do, and this one is not so shocking anymore. Bird bites really hurt though.</p> <p>There are two forms of biting cases in pet birds. With<strong> baby birds</strong>, there is a stage in their growth that is called “<strong>teething stage</strong>”.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-being-you-know-birds-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>In this case, baby birds will bite (“beak”) everything that comes in contact with them. A bird’s beak is filled with encased nerve endings and is used in experiencing sensations, textures, tastes, the hardness or softness of an object or their food and many others. In these instances, the “beaking” cannot be considered as biting, but more of a "<strong>habitual</strong>" thing that they do.</p> This behavior may also lead to biting later when it grows up, so this can be discouraged by directing your pet bird to an appropriate object such as <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-toys" title="bird chew toys"><strong>bird toys or something chewable</strong></a> and safe approved by your vet.<br> <p>With older birds, biting is obviously the most ultimate <strong>form of showing dissatisfaction</strong>. Birds bite not just for fun or anger; they do so for some reasons such as when they feel threatened, startled, or anxious. Birds also bite as a defensive action, like when they protect their nest or when the owner did something that the bird dislikes.</p> <p>Birds may also bite their mate or their beloved human owners in an attempt of protecting them. It can also be caused by a <strong>displaced aggression</strong>. When your bird is unable to bite the object it desires, it will bite the <strong>closest thing available </strong>(even their <strong>bird cage</strong><u>)</u>. When encouraging a bird to step up onto your hand, do not misunderstand an open beak aimed at your hand as an attempt to bite.</p> <p>Birds almost always "test" a perch's stability before stepping onto it, and will touch his beak to your hand before stepping onto it or sometimes you use it as an extra appendage to help them get up their perching spot.<br><br><br></p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Who Is Making That Catcall?</strong></h2> <p>(Why do Birds Whistle, Talk, and Sing?)</p> <p>Hearing Birds sing early in the morning is a great way to start a day together with your typical hot coffee and the gentle breeze from your window right? Well do you know why your lovely pet bird sings or whistles? Or do you ever wonder what the meaning is when your birds talk?</p> <p>These activities done by our birds is a <strong>form of contentment</strong> and usually indulged when they are <strong>feeling safe, secure, and contented with their surroundings</strong>. You can usually hear them at times during the early morning when the sun is getting ready to rise, and at dusk when the sun is setting down.</p> <p>It also occurs at times when the bird is <strong>feeling happy and excited</strong>. This is one of the <strong>positive traits</strong> that our feathery friends possess and it is a great thing to listen too, so it is really important to keep your pet birds happy and contented.<br><br><br></p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Not the Sofa Again!</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: center;">(Why does my pet parrot destroys things?)</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-being-you-know-birds-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p><strong>Destructive behavior</strong> is often seen in <strong>most parrots</strong>. It is a sign when out feathery friend is either has a problem with his or her environment and or is not receiving enough vital mental and physical simulation to keep its mind and body occupied and active. Birds are very intelligent and social animals and they need a lot of attention in order to keep them from being bored.</p> <p><strong>Boredom</strong> is one thing that can cause <strong>health problems</strong> to your pet bird. So, if your bird is showing some signs of blatant destructive behavior (such as destroying its cage, chewing bird toys, and other things it see) it may be a good idea to assess how you are spending your time with your pet, and take steps to make your pet bird more included in your daily activities. Pay attention to them more. By doing so, you can greatly reduce destructive tendencies in most pet birds.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Cut It Out Birdie!</strong></h2> <p>(Why do these birds scream?)</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-being-you-know-birds-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></p> <strong>Screaming</strong> is one of the most <strong>undesired behaviors</strong> of many birds reported by owners and their neighbors respectively. While a lot of healthy birds will scream and vocalized at some point throughout the day, <strong>problematic screaming</strong> can be <strong>out of boredom, depression</strong>, or <strong>some other type of stress</strong> that your bird is currently experiencing.<br><br> <p>Consider all factors and consult and avian vet to rule out any medical problems, or you may want to talk to a parrot behavior consultant for some help with modifying your pet’s behavior if the screaming doesn’t begin to calm down.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Birdie, U Mad?</strong></h2> <p>(Feathers are too beautiful to be plucked)</p> <p>Birds comes in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors but some of them really standing out from the crowd, whether it is growing specialized beaks or setting record-breaking flights. Birds always find a way to astonish us in every way possible, which also includes birds flaunting their eye-catching and mesmerizing feathers.At some point in their life, they will pluck their feathers for a particular reason.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/birds-being-you-know-birds-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>But why do Birds pluck their feathers? And what is the meaning of feather-plucking?</p> <p><strong>Feather plucking</strong> is generally regarded as a <strong>multi-factorial disorder</strong> (and also makes them look like a dressed chicken). This occurs when birds are <strong>severely depressed</strong> and <strong>very unsettled</strong> due to their environment. Birds that are stressed will pluck their feathers as means of <strong>pacifying themselves</strong> and sometimes doing it <strong>out of boredom or lack of interaction</strong> (just like when a deranged person tears their hair of from their heads). This could also be the effect of some certain medical issues such as problems with their diet, toxic exposures and infections. In captivity, a bird that usually plucks their feathers can be a sign of veterinary or <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/environmental-impact-of-birds" title="environmental impact of birds"><strong>environmental problems</strong></a>, and the damage is usually concentrated on their breast, neck, wings and tails, parts in which their beaks can reach easily. (Visit <a href="https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-pet-bird-behavior-problems-390319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bird Behavior</a> to know more.)</p> <p>Possible causes of this habit may include:</p> <ul> <li>Disease like feather cyst</li> <li>Parasites (such as ringworm)</li> <li>Emotional stress</li> <li>Boredom</li> <li>Skin infections or inflammations</li> <li>Malnutrition</li> <li>Dryness of the skin due to humidity</li> <li>Lack of natural sunlight and fresh air</li> </ul> <p>Birds that are <strong>overactive and overstimulated</strong> tend to <strong>pluck</strong> their feathers too. If you noticed large featherless patches on your pet bird, you should immediately consult with an avian vet to rule out the possibility of diseases such as Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease, or PBFD.</p> <p><strong>Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)</strong> is a <strong>viral disease</strong> that affects all old world and new world parrots. The acute form of the disease is demonstrated by lethargy, loss of appetite, vomiting and diarrhea. Since the immune system is heavily infected and it's functions decreased, other diseases and infections may develop, causing death within approximately two to four weeks.</p> <p>Typical ratification of the acute form of the disease is by <strong>necropsy</strong> (just a tip: any word that describes something and starts with the word "necro" is typically a bad thing), because it progresses too quickly for the normal signs such as feather loss and beak deformity to appear.</p> <p> </p> <h2> <strong><span style="color: #660000;">How to prevent this disastrous feather plucking disorder?
