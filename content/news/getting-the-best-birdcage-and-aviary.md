<p>One of the important rules when <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/shall-i-get-a-bird-as-a-pet" title="Shall I Get A Bird As A Pet"><strong>owning a bird</strong></a> is to provide them with a comfortable living space. It is probably the most costly purchase you make for your bird or birds. But remember, it will be the place your pet bird will likely spend the rest of its life. So choose the right home wisely.</p> <p>But first, what is the difference of a <strong>birdcage and bird aviaries</strong>?</p> <p>People tend to complicate aviaries with bird cages, thinking that they’re one and the same thing. For those who want to know the difference between each:</p> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.mybirdshouse.com/blogs/my-bird-cage-blog/rules-for-choosing-a-bird-cage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-1.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a><span style="color: #e69138;"><strong>Aviaries</strong></span> are <strong>large enclosures for confining birds</strong> but <strong>have larger living spaces</strong> than typical bird cages. Aviaries also give birds <strong>more space to fly</strong> and are usually designed to mimic a <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/birds-habitat" title="Birds Habitat "><strong>bird’s natural habitat</strong></a>. Because these cages allow birds to fly, they are sometimes referred to as flight cages. Plus, aviaries will also allow you to <strong>house a number of bird species</strong>.<br><br>Aviaries are favorable because they provide large areas for birds, often with the<strong> intent of breeding</strong>. They can be either indoors or outdoors. Some birds are very noisy and can be annoyance to close neighbors. So if your birds are loud, you may want to keep them in an <a href="https://amzn.to/2M717ei" target="_blank" title="Bird Ferret Parrot Cage Aviary" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>indoor aviary</strong></a>.<br><br><strong>Indoor aviaries</strong> give you the ability to control temperature, lighting, noise and humidity. The windows are protected with wire and the door often has a wired porch with two doors to pass through.<br><br>These are to <strong>keep your birds from flying out</strong>. Some indoor aviaries are simply a bird room with extra-large cages. Doing it this way, the doors and windows don't need to be screened in.<br><br><a href="https://www.mybirdshouse.com/blogs/my-bird-cage-blog/rules-for-choosing-a-bird-cage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-2.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a><strong>Outdoor aviaries</strong> can give your birds with a natural environment and are designed in a wide variety of styles. Because the birds kept in outdoor aviaries are exposed to the weather, they must also have a sheltering, possibly heated or cooled if conditions get extreme.<br><br>These aviaries always need a shaded area and wind breaks. Trees or branches can fit in nicely to create a comfortable home, but must be of non-toxic woods.<br><br><a href="https://www.mybirdshouse.com/blogs/my-bird-cage-blog/rules-for-choosing-a-bird-cage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-3.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a><span style="color: #e69138;"><strong>Bird cages</strong></span> on the other hand, are cages <strong>designed to house birds as pets</strong>. They are often considered <strong>too small to house more than two complimenting species at a time</strong>. <br><br>Some people <strong>used it for home décor</strong> (see also: <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/bird-cage-aesthetics" title="Bird Cage Aesthetics"><strong><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Birdcage Aesthetics"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'>Birdcage Aesthetics</span></strong></a>)<strong><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Birdcage Aesthetics"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":16957,"3":[null,0],"5":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"6":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"7":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"8":{"1":[{"1":2,"2":0,"5":[null,2,0]},{"1":0,"2":0,"3":3},{"1":1,"2":0,"4":1}]},"12":0,"17":1}'> </span></strong>without live birds in it, unlike aviaries.</p> <p style="float: left;"><br>Cages are also too small for birds to have any flying space and <strong>choosing cages also depends on the size and species of birds you want to get</strong>. There are important rules when putting up your bird cage or aviaries. </p> <p><strong>Three Main Considerations in selecting the Perfect Bird Cages and Aviaries are:</strong> </p> <ul> <li>Safety for your Bird</li> <li>Suitable Size</li> <li>Ease of Maintenance</li> </ul> <p>Beyond these vital needs there are other possibilities to explore that will transform this important habitat into a good-looking and comfortable home. Some pretty <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cages" title="bird cages"><strong>cool cages</strong></a> and <strong>bird aviaries </strong>can be found here in online stores like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au</a>.</p> <p>So whether you prefer to get a bird cage or a bird aviary, there are important things you need to remember if you are to ensure that they will live in a safe, healthy and happy bird environment. For one, your cages or aviaries will be <strong>determined by the number of bird species</strong> you want to breed and the weather conditions where you live. Gardens are usually the best places to build your aviaries in while indoors would be the best place for bird cages. Visit <a href="http://www.5star.cleaning/cage-vs-aviaries-which-one-should-you-choose/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bird Care</a> for more information to help you choose the right Cage or Aviaries for your feathered friend.</p> <p>So when choosing the perfect one for your feathered friend, there are various models and sizes to choose from. Whether you are getting a <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw" title="The Red Talker of the Amazon - The Scarlett Macaw"><strong>Macaw</strong></a>, Kookaburra or a <a href="https://amzn.to/2JIXLfe" target="_blank" title="Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand-alone Budgie Perch " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Parrot cage</strong></a>, you can make the right decision by following these simple guidelines:<br><br><br></p> <h3><strong>Location:<br><br></strong></h3> <p>Some cages use a big portion of a house or apartment depending on the size of your bird also. If you have a big feathered friend then it will surely use up a couple of spaces in your house.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>It would be best if the placement of the cage have an entry or window for sunshine (not direct sunlight please) and fresh air (depending on the season of course).</p> <p>Place the cage in a warm, bright part of the house close to where the action is but <strong>away from drafts</strong>. Drafts <strong>can cause sickness</strong>. Adjust vents so they do not blow directly on the cage. Some places their bird cage against a wall or corner to make the birds feel secure and comfortable.</p> <p><strong>Do not place them in the kitchen</strong> or<strong> near it</strong> to prevent them from inhaling smoke and vapors. It may harm the birds for they are vulnerable to fumes and toxins. On the other hand, aviaries are usually put outdoors because of its size. But make sure to also give it the same considerations like the indoor bird cages.</p> <p>Our birds also need social interaction and growth that’s why these cages should not be isolated. An area with family activity, gives the bird with the most socialization, it is probably the best place to keep your companion. The family or recreation room is the best place for your bird.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Cage Size and Bar Spacing:</strong><br><br> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">All birds should be lodged in a cage or aviaries that are as spacious as possible, this is especially important for birds that will spend most or all of their time in it.<br><br>But before purchasing, <strong>consider the size of your bird first.</strong><br><br><a href="https://amzn.to/2mZpH5U%EF%BB%BF" target="_blank" title="The Cape Cod Chic White Birdcages Set of 2 White Metal " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Small cages</strong></a> are perfect for bird breeds like Canaries, Cockatiels, Finches and Parakeets.<br><br>However, for birds like Parrots and Cockatoos you will need a bigger cage. Not purchasing the right cage may lead to undesirable behaviors to your pet.<br><br>Birds need to stretch their wings and flap them comfortably without hitting anything. Should have enough space to hop or walk around and play with bird toys.<br><br>Birds that live entirely in a cage will need a space of three times their wing span as an absolute minimum, with more space being better. This is why people often choose aviaries for birds to move comfortably.<br><br>Smaller birds require bar spacing that are not more than half an inch apart. This will prevent them from trying to squeeze in and get their heads stuck between the bars. As for larger birds, always opt for cages with horizontal bar spacing as it provides them with opportunities for climbing and exercise.<br><br>Vertical bars are hard for birds to climb. Smooth vertical bars are slippery and birds tend to slip. <strong>Galvanized metal </strong>which has been <strong>electroplated is safe</strong>, <strong>but</strong> <strong>galvanized wire (hot dipped) is not</strong>.<br><br><br></p> <h2>Style and Craftsmanship:<br><br> </h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The shape and style is also worth thinking about. Many experts say that round bird cages are actually negative to your bird's psychological health, look for an angled or rectangular bird cages instead. You should avoid bird cages with sharp ends or loose parts as they are more as attractive and less useful in term of living space. You can also put them on a stand or hang them as they come in different styles and shapes.<br><br>Another thing to deliberate is the quality and craftsmanship of the bird cage. The one you select should be solid and durable enough to protect them for external elements. The best ones are those composed of stainless steel; they are not hard to clean, non-toxic and doesn’t have cracking paint chips.<br><br>Thus, you should purchase one that doesn’t pose any health hazards to your precious feathered friend.<br><br></p> <h3> <strong>Here are some of the Popular Cages:</strong><br><br><br> </h3> <h3>Dome top cages</h3> <img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-7.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br> <p><br><br>These cages have an expanded, curved top section as compared to the traditional box shape. <br><br>The interior space in these cages is good for active birds who like to climb or fly</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h3>Play top cages</h3> <img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-8.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"><br> <p><br><br>For active birds that spend large amounts of time outside of their home. <br><br>Many models have a built-in play top that allows your bird out-of-cage time to play and interact with the family.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <h2></h2> <h2><strong>Perches</strong></h2> <p> </p> <p><strong>Perches</strong><span> </span>and<span> </span><strong>stands</strong><span> </span>are<span> </span><strong>important parts</strong><span> </span>of a pet bird's environment. You never see them lie down. These perches are used for standing, playing, cleaning their beaks, climbing and entertainment. Our feathered friends can get sore feet if the diameter of the perch is the same all the time.</p> <p>The size and shape can vary depending on the type of bird. It is important to provide a variety of shapes, sizes and textures. It alters the weight-bearing areas of the foot which permits the bird to exercise, strengthen and condition their feet, and reduces the chance of severe foot problems and sores.<br><br><br></p> <p>There are numerous choices of perching material. <br><br></p> <img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-9.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"><br> <ul> <li>Wood is by far the most frequently used material, with natural branches being ideal. <br><br>They give a completely natural surface for the bird's feet and can provide hours of chewing fun.<br><br><br> </li> <li>Birds can also be given one ceramic or cement perch among their many perches to aid in safely wearing the beak and nails down.<br><br> </li> <li> <p>Plastic perches are durable and easy to clean but can be slippery and provide less texture for gripping.</p> </li> </ul> <img alt="" src="/img/news/getting-the-best-birdcage-and-aviary-10.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"> <p> </p> <p>A significant factor in selecting perches is <strong>stability</strong>. Make sure to mount perches tightly. A loose, unsteady or slippery perch <strong>may contribute to falling accidents</strong> and <strong>weaken your bird’s feeling of security</strong>.</p> <p>Lastly, clean the perches regularly. To minimize soiling place them in the cage to prevent contamination from feces. Perches should be washed with soap and water and can be sandpapered to remove debris.</p> <p>Small<strong> bird perches </strong>that may fit in the oven can be baked at 200 degrees for a couple of hours to rid them any pests. Larger perches can be left in the direct sun until carefully dried which also helps disinfect them. Some perches that are damaged from chewing or become heavily soiled should be thrown away and replaced.</p> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Bird Cage Safety and Cleaning</strong></h2> <p> </p> <p>It is very imperative that you know how to take care of a pet bird to keep it safe.
