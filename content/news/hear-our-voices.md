<p>When you think about pet birds, what is one defining trait about them that comes to mind? If it's the fact that some of them can learn to talk, then you are like many people. Birds have many attractive qualities, but their ability to repeat human speech is one that makes them truly unique among other types of companion pets and one that has ensured their popularity for many years.</p> <p>Explore some of the most popular talking bird species below, and learn more about what these impressive birds can offer those who decide to adopt them. You will find that their talent for mimicry pales in comparison to their ability to be charming, engaging, and truly remarkable pets.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Budgies (Parakeets)</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>It comes as a surprise to many, but the tiny Budgies (also known as Budgerigars or simply as Parakeets) can actually talk as well if not better than some larger parrot species. Some Budgies have even been known to develop vocabularies of hundreds of words.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>They have gruff little voices, so it can sometimes be hard to decipher what exactly they are trying to say, but those who keep and care for them often find that their little birds become quite the chatterboxes in time. Just like any type of bird, not all <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/my-budgie-companion" title="my budgie companion"><strong>Budgies will learn to talk</strong></a>, so please don't adopt one solely on the basis of wanting a talking bird—and that goes for all species.<br><br></p> <h3> <span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Care and Feeding:</strong></span><br><br> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/choosing-a-qualified-avian-vet-390396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>While many commercial budgie diets consist of only seeds, they alone do not provide adequate nutrition for pet birds. Most <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/choosing-a-qualified-avian-vet-390396" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">veterinarians</a> recommend that budgies are placed on a diet of a variety of vegetables,. They should also be fed a formulated pelleted diet as they contain important vitamins and nutrients and can be fortified with additional supplements. Budgies should also be offered a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, including <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/super-vegetables-for-your-parrots-390197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leafy greens</a>, root vegetables and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/five-minute-meal-bird-will-love-390177" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grains</a>.<br><br>They tolerate seed more readily than other species but seed should not be fed as their only source of food. An <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/all-seed-diet-damaging-birds-health-390169" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all seed diet</a> can be dangerous and even fatal. <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/chop-concept-revolutionary-way-feed-birds-390189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chop</a> is easily made and frozen and can be helpful in keeping these charming and lovely birds healthy. <br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Exercise:</strong></span></h3> <p>Budgies are <strong>active little birds</strong> and need exercise every day to keep themselves in top shape. Captive budgies, particularly those that live in small cages, should be allowed out for at least a couple of hours daily in a secure area so they can explore and stretch their wings.</p> <p>Invest in a cage that is longer than it is wide. This allows your budgie to flit from perch to perch and get plenty of exercise inside of his enclosure as well as the freedom to spend time with you in your home.

In addition to talking, Amazon parrots are great at learning tricks, making them a very entertaining bird for those who want a pet that they can interact with often.<br><br><br></p> <h3> <span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Care And Feeding:</strong></span><br><br> </h3> <p>Amazon parrots have a <strong>tendency toward becoming couch potatoes</strong>, sitting around a good part of the day, eating starchy foods. But there are <strong>consequences</strong> for an obese bird: <strong>fatty tumors and a greatly reduced life span</strong>.</p> <p>Like most Amazon parrots, orange wings are among the longer-lived parrot species; make sure that your children or a good-natured neighbor love the bird too because they just might inherit him.</p> <p><strong>Good nutrition</strong>, including lots of fruits, vegetables and nutritionally balanced pelleted diet, and lots of playtime and exercise will keep your Amazon in good shape for years to come. </p> <p>Parrots in general, and Amazons in particular, are long-lived animals if cared for properly. The orange-winged Amazon can likely live upwards of 80 years if given the proper housing, nutrition, exercise, and socialization.<br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Exercise:</strong></span></h2> <h3></h3> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></h3> <h3></h3> <ul> <li><span style="color: #b45f06; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Climbing</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Climbing is one of the best ways you can exercise your parrot. If you do not have anywhere safe to take your parrot out, a pet shop ladder will give him some exercise and he will use it over and over during the day.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you put your finger next to your bird´s chest, she will climb up. You can put her down somewhere else, and then repeat this again to make sure she has enough exercise for the moment.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #b45f06; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Beating Wings</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">There are a lot of ways to provide this exercise. One good method is just to allow your bird to perch on your hand and then move it up and down or around in a circle. Be sure to hold on to her feet as you do this, since sometimes she will become so excited flapping her wings that she will fall off of your hand.</p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #b45f06; font-size: 15px;"><strong style="font-size: 15px;">Playing Games</strong></span></li> </ul> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">Your parrot is intelligent, and it is up to you to invent new games and keep her stimulated. Some birds like to play football (or soccer), and will sit on the floor passing a small ball back and forth.

Make sure that she has a good physical exam before you start her exercise program; blood work, a fecal exam, and tests that your vet recommends are a good place to start.</div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">If your parrot is aggressive, you might find that providing an outlet for her natural energy will make her a better part of the family. Since wild parrots have so many things to do as part of their daily routine, birds that are not exercised become bored and misbehave.</div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;">Start slowly, but exercise your parrot every day. She will thank you for it.<br><br><br> </div> <h2> <strong>Quaker Parrots</strong><br><br><strong> </strong> </h2> <p>The adorable Quaker Parrots, also known as <strong>Monk Parakeets</strong>, have long been prized for their talking talents and charming personalities. Quakers are able to build quite large vocabularies, and some Quaker owners swear that their birds are even able to use the words that they know in context. While this hasn't been proven, what is known is that these birds are extremely intelligent and that they bond strongly to their owners.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Quaker parrots are a good choice for people who want all the fun of a larger parrot in a more compact package. They have big personalities, and that's part of what makes them so beloved in the eyes of their owners.<br><br></p> <h3><strong><span style="color: #38761d;">Feeding:</span></strong></h3> <p>Quakers are known to be extremely good eaters. They thrive on fresh fruits and <strong>vegetables, leafy greens, nuts and healthy table food</strong>. Fresh vegetables such as root vegetables, peppers, and colorful produce are critical in their diets.</p> <p>They do well in homes when this diet is supplemented with quality commercially formulated pellets and healthy seed such as hemp, flax and chia seed. The occasional millet sprig is welcomed as a favorite snack.</p> <p> Some quakers tend to become overweight if allowed to indulge in too many fattening nuts and seed treats, so be sure to offer your Quaker fresh greens, legumes, pasta, and other vegetables as a main food source.<br><br></p> <h3><strong><span style="color: #38761d;">Exercise:</span></strong></h3> <p style="float: right;"><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/are-play-gyms-necessary-390348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;"></a>Quakers are very active birds, and need to have an adequate amount of space in which to play. Provide your Quaker with plenty of toys, and a play gym as a place to burn off their energy and play. Providing toys on the <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/are-play-gyms-necessary-390348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gym</a> is always welcome and they will give your Quaker parrot something to do.

Lots of small toys such as balls, bells and smaller chew toys will engage and interest your bird in play time activity.<br><br><br></p> <h2><strong>Indian Ringneck Parakeet (Rose-Ringed Parakee) <br></strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-7.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Hailing from India and Asia, the charming Indian Ringneck Parakeets have been kept as pets for centuries—at first being reserved for royalty only, specifically because of their incredible speaking abilities. <br><br> Years ago, monks observed these birds in the gardens where they said their daily prayers, and saw that the birds eventually began to repeat the prayers that they were hearing every day. This led to the belief that the birds were holy or divine, which was why only royalty was allowed to keep them as pets.<br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Feeding</strong></span></h3> <p>Wild Indian Ringnecks usually feast on a diet of fruits, vegetables, <a href="https://nuts.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nuts</a>, berries, and <a href="https://amzn.to/2M5z4f6%EF%BB%BF" target="_blank" title="Audubon Park 12261 Black Oil Sunflower Seed Wild Bird Food " rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>seeds</strong></a>.</p> <p>In the wild, they live in lightly timbered areas, as well as farmed areas of the countryside. They <strong>can be found</strong> in <strong>western and southern areas of Sudan</strong>.</p> <p>This species is <strong>quite popular in the middle east</strong> and they are often bred there, but they can still be <strong>found in the wild</strong>. They travel in flocks, so they are used to having company. In the wild, they eat berries, fruit, nectar from flowers, and the flowers themselves.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>While most vets agree that it is best for captive birds to eat a nutritionally balanced pelleted diet, a Ringneck will appreciate a variety of fruits and vegetables in their diet. Leafy greens and <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/super-vegetables-for-your-parrots-390197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vegetables</a> are crucial for any companion parrot for a nutritionally sound diet, and the Indian</p> <p>Ringneck parrot is no exception. As with all birds, food and water containers should be emptied, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/ways-to-streamline-pet-bird-care-390748" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cleaned</a>, and refilled daily to reduce the risk of bacterial growth and infection.<br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Exercise</strong></span></h3> <p>Parakeets are very active birds. As with most other bird species, it is a good idea to have a safe area for the pet to play and stretch its wings.</p> <p>Ringnecks also have powerful jaw muscles to maintain, so it is wise to provide an array of <strong>chewable toys</strong>, perches, and <strong>cage accessories</strong> so that the bird is less likely to gnaw on something valuable or dangerous.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>African Grey Parrots</strong> <br><br> </h2> <p>Over the past several years, the African Grey Parrots have seen a rise in popularity as pets, largely due to studies that have given us greater insight into the extreme intelligence of these birds. They are excellent talkers and most learn to pick up words quite readily and speak them with great clarity.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/hear-our-voices-9.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>There are even rumors of people who have been fooled into thinking that they were talking to a family member in another room, only to find that it was their pet African Grey mimicking another person's voice.These captivating birds are no doubt fascinating, but they require a lot of specialized care—so bringing one home is not something to be taken lightly.<br><br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Feeding</strong></span></h3> <p>As with most exotic bird species, a meal consists of fresh vegetables including <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/parrot-nutrition-1236730" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">leafy greens</a> such as arugula, watercress, kale, sprouts, and healthy seed like hemp and flax seed. </p> <p><a href="https://www.thespruce.com/chop-concept-revolutionary-way-feed-birds-390189" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chop</a> will help keep your Grey healthy and thriving. Fruits such as pomegranate, organic mango, and melon supplemented with a quality formulated pelleted diet is best for the African Grey. Many Greys also enjoy a variety of treats and snacks such as nuts, healthy table food like steamed green beans, <a href="https://www.thespruce.com/vitamin-rich-foods-for-pet-birds-390626" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breakfast toasts</a> and the occasional bit of your leftover salad would be nirvana for these beautiful birds.<br><br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Exercise</strong></span></h3> <p>Adequate amounts of exercise are crucial to maintaining the <u>health</u> of a <u>companion</u> African Grey.</p> <p>Pet Greys should be allowed to spend a minimum of one to two hours out of their <u>cages</u> daily and should be provided with plenty of bird-safe chew toys to facilitate exercising their powerful beaks.

A <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #f6b26b;"><strong>perspex box</strong></span> is a new option on the market allowing the bird to sit inside and eat its food without making a mess. These less mess options are best for reducing the prevalence of rodents and other pests.</p> Alternatively, stainless bowls are a great option for ease of cleaning.

Just as there are quiet, shy people, there are quiet and shy birds. And, just as with people, some birds are smarter than others.</p> <p> Do your research before adopting a bird and find a breeder who can introduce you to the breeding pair, so that you at least have an idea of the capabilities of the bird you will be adopting.</p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
