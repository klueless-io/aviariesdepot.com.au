<p>"Sometimes, in order to stand out, you need to be just <strong>as simple as one can be</strong>". That's the motto of the humble Eclectus parrot (well, I'm saying humble that is compared to its other parrot cousins like the <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/the-red-talker-of-the-amazon-the-scarlet-macaw" title="The Red Talker of the Amazon - The Scarlett Macaw"><strong>scarlet macaw</strong> </a>and the blue-and-yellow macaw). The strikingly beautiful Eclectus hails from the South Pacific, mainly from the tropical and monsoon forests of Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands.</p> <p>Eclectus are known as <strong>sexually dimorphic</strong>, meaning that you can <strong>tell the sex of the bird by the color of its feathers</strong> (well, that was easy). <strong>Male Eclectus</strong> are a vivid emerald green color, with bright tangerine beaks and a red and blue spattering under their wings. The <strong>females</strong>, on the other hand, are mostly deep cherry red, with black beaks and deep lavender markings on their chests and tails. In the past, these birds <strong>were thought to be completely different species by ornithologists who first saw them</strong>.</p> <p>There are <strong>nine subspecies of eclectus parrots</strong> that are already known, even though the species as a whole needs further study and reviewing. Access to some regions where the species dwell is difficult due to geographical (or sometimes political reasons), for that reason, field observations have been limited. Furthermore, many skins collected in the early part of the 19th century have deteriorated in some museums (which are pretty useless for thorough studies). Luckily, most Eclectus' skins in US museums are in mint condition.

They are quite satisfied to just sit on a <span style="color: #ff9900;"><strong>perch</strong></span> for hours at a time playing with their <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-toys" title="bird toys "><strong>toys</strong> </a>(just like that one classmate you have in first grade who has no friends).</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/simple-yet-striking-the-eclectus-parrot-4.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">They <strong>do not like any clamor</strong> and they <strong>do not react well to it</strong> (they prefer a quiet and serene environment above all else). They are <strong>placid birds in captivity,</strong> but will display a solemn nature when new things or situations arrive.<br><br>They d<strong>o not adjust easily to new circumstances or environments</strong> so owners must be patient and adjust to having a kind of bashful, three year old child-type companion. They can be very <strong>territorial of their cage area.</strong> So you need to <strong>let it go out of its cage a couple of times a day</strong>.<br><br>The Eclectus parrot's personality has been misunderstood. Many have said this species is boring, dull, lethargic and even stupid. This is not the case. The Eclectus exhibiting these behaviors is showing its <strong>reaction to stress</strong>. The Eclectus is <strong>an intelligent bird</strong> and when taught properly, they are capable of sensible behavior from a very young age. (I prefer a timid Eclectus over a hyperactive macaw at any day)<br><br><img alt="" src="/img/news/simple-yet-striking-the-eclectus-parrot-5.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">Unlike <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><strong>lorikeets</strong> </span>and macaws, The Eclectus is <strong>not a nagging bird and is relatively easy to care for</strong> (as long as you don't change your daily routine with him). Since they adjust to new things slowly, you need more patience and consideration in taking care of him, like when <strong>introducing a new toy to him</strong>.<br><br>Introduce the new toy to him <strong>gradually by placing it <a href="https://amzn.to/2JIXLfe" target="_blank" title="Bird Cage Parrot Aviary Pet Stand-alone Budgie Perch Castor Wheels " rel="noopener noreferrer">outside his cage</a></strong> and let him <strong>get accustomed to if for the next few days before placing it beside its cage.</strong><br><br>If he gets curious and plays with it (even if it was still outside his cage) then that's the time you place it inside his cage for him to play. They indeed <strong>love new toys</strong> but suddenly placing it inside their cage may instill panic and stress to them.<br><br>If you have a lot of people in your house, especially with children who runs and plays around frequently, and also lots of activities and noise happening around, then the Eclectus may not be the best choice for a pet bird for you. They do make a good companion to people with a much quieter homes with pretty much less activity going on (especially to older people who lives in quiet homes) and people who live alone and rarely has company (just make sure that there are no new activities going on around and the daily routine is properly maintained). Some Eclectus can sometimes be noisy and are best suited to places where their loud call doesn’t bother anyone (like rest houses or quiet farms).<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dwelling</strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/simple-yet-striking-the-eclectus-parrot-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>Basic care for these parrots includes their <strong>housing requirements</strong> and there are two ways that you can provide for your bird's dwelling</p> You can buy a <strong>bird aviary </strong>to ensure that your pair of Eclectus parrots have a large room to fly around. Optimal minimum size of the aviary for a pair of Eclectus parrots should have a ceiling height of 6 feet (about 180 cm) and a floor space of 3 feet by 5 feet (100 x 150 cm) with. Perches should be placed in various locations around the bird aviary and should be made of natural wood with a diameter of around 2 to 4 inches. You also make sure that there are lots of playthings around like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cages/products/large-house-proof-birdcage-with-chew-toys-accessories-1" title="LARGE HOUSE-PROOF BIRDCAGE WITH CHEW TOYS &amp; ACCESSORIES "><strong>climbing ropes</strong>, <strong>wooden hanging chew toys and parrot swings inside the cage</strong></a>.<br> <ul></ul> If you are planning to buy a bird cage for a single Eclectus parrot, pick a <strong>larger cage</strong> with a ceiling height of at least 3 feet and floor space of at least 3 feet by 3 feet (1 m x 1 m), complete with bird perches and toys too (although you need to let out your Eclectus at least 2 hours a day for they really need to fly around to stay fit and healthy).

Since Eclectus <strong>don't eat many seeds in the wild,</strong> and since they are deficient in so many nutrients, it is advised to incorporate pelleted bird food that is high in vitamins and minerals on their diet to supplement their nutritional needs.</p> <p><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>There are also some things that you should never feed to your Eclectus parrot, such as:</strong></span></p> <ul> <li>Avocado(both flesh and seed contains toxins deadly to birds)</li> <li>Rhubarb</li> <li>Apple seeds</li> <li>Seeds from stone fruit</li> <li>Lettuce(has little nutritional value and can cause diarrhea and lead to dehydration)</li> <li>Onions and Garlic</li> <li>Raw meat of any kind</li> <li>Cheese(can cause crop impaction)</li> <li>Chocolate (yes, chocolate, and of any form)</li> <li>Coffee (caffeine is bad for them)</li> <li>Soft drinks</li> <li>Milk or dairy products(some birds are lactose intolerant and can also lead to crop impaction)</li> <li>Fatty foods or fast food (especially ones with high MSG content)</li> <li>Alcohol</li> </ul> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/simple-yet-striking-the-eclectus-parrot-8.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Eclectusrequire a diet high in Beta Carotene and vegetable protein. Their digestive tract is longer than most other species, with a larger proventriculus (the narrow glandular first region of a bird's stomach between the crop and the gizzard) and longer intestines, so fat intake must be limited to avoid fatty tumors (this does not mean that you need to eliminate fat in their diet, for youngsters who are very active needs fat to grow up healthy). Some fat is needed to store the fat-soluble vitamins A, E, and D.<br><br>Also, with all species, if cholesterol levels are too high, the excess collects in the liver and, through the blood stream, travels to the heart where it accumulates and may cause:</p> <ul> <li>Fatigue</li> <li>Failure to breed</li> <li>Secondary nutrient deficiency problems (such as Candida, hypocalcemia, hypoprotenia, and so on)</li> <li>Fatty liver disease</li> <li>Poor feather quality and discoloration</li> <li>General unthriftiness</li> <li>And the inability of the other nutrients to be properly utilized</li> </ul> <p>Eclectus are not really picky eaters, so you need to watch out your pet birds all the time to ensure that he eats the right food and the right amounts of it.
