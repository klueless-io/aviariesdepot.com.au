<p>Bird cages are homes for <strong>domesticated birds</strong>. Birds require a house in which they can fly and have some freedom but still ensures they do not fly away. Bird cages are constructed to be <strong>large enough to accommodate the motion and daily activities of domesticated birds</strong>. Cages are generally constructed of wire mesh. Some manufacturers flatten the mesh and others leave the wire round just as it is obtained from the manufacturer.</p> <p>Cages must be constructed with mesh carefully welded in a grid that will not permit a bird to put his or her head through the mesh and strangle. The mesh is generally 1.5 × I in (3.8 × 2.5 cm) in grid. Even larger birds such as parrots are rarely put into cages with mesh larger than 1 × 1 in (2.5 × 2.5 cm).

For this reason, the cage should be located in a spot where the floor is easily cleaned. Tile, concrete or hard wood floors are preferable. Carpet would not be a good alternative for this area.

In addition, birds are not generally house trained in the way a dog or cat can be, and they excrete their waste when and where the mood strikes them. The article gives us some great tips on how to easily clean these messes up and also provides some tips on how to make clean up easier and some preventative measures to make your daily cleaning adventure easier as well. <br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>How to Manage Your Pet Bird’s Mess</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>If you share your life and home with a pet bird, containing mess and keeping the cage clean can be a daily battle. After all, there is no such thing as a tidy bird. Molted feathers, droppings, chewed-up toys, empty seed hulls and flung food birds can be quite messy.<br><br></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lock-me-up-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p><br>Fortunately, companion bird enthusiasts do get a little help by the fact that many of today’s cages are designed with mess management in mind. (If your bird’s cage is stuck in the ’80s or ’90s, this is even more reason to update!) Take a close look at the cage, and you’ll notice some features you might have taken for granted.</p> <p>For example, the slanted bottom panels help waste roll down into the bottom tray of the cage and not out on the floor. And don’t take for granted the fact that the bottom tray is fully removable — which is as good of a reason as any to give it a thorough scrubbing periodically.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Manage to Do the Following:</strong><br><br> </h2> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lock-me-up-5.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px;"></h3> <h3><strong><span style="color: #38761d;">Be On Guard</span></strong></h3> <p style="float: left;">Seed guards, the little mesh netting placed on the outer perimeter of the cage, have been around years and they can be pretty handy at stopping those annoying little seed hulls from floating out of the cage whenever your bird flaps his or her wings.<br><br></p> <h3><strong><span style="color: #38761d;">Put a Hood On It</span></strong></h3> <p>Some pet bird product manufacturers offer products geared toward stopping food-generated mess at the source, in and around the food cups. Some have a hooded top, either as one complete cup design or as a detachable piece. Essentially, the bird leans into the feeding station to eat, so a good deal of the food debris is contained within the cup.

When your bird is in the center of the cage, there is less likely to be cage fallout.<br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Line It Up</strong></span></h3> <p>Most bird people know the trick of stacking up a few layers or more of newspaper or cage liner, so all they have to do is remove the top soiled one and a clean layer will be ready to go. The “roll and go” works even more efficiently if you keep a trash bin near by; the farther you have to walk to reach a trash can, the more likely you are to leave a little debris trail from the rolled up liner.<br><br></p> <h3><span style="color: #38761d;"><strong>Watch What They Eats</strong></span></h3> <p>Of course, the types of food your bird eats and how you serve it can directly affect cleanup. If your bird eats mostly seed, chances are, there are seeds and discarded hulls outside the bowl and outside the cage. And if you’re in the habit of dumping seed on top of yesterday’s seed, the mess is likely bigger.</p> <p> </p> <blockquote> <h3><span style="color: #b45f06;"><strong>Quick Reminder:</strong></span></h3> </blockquote> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lock-me-up-6.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">The larger the bird, the more space you’ll need. Cages made from metal are easier to clean, and cleaning the cage is something you’ll need to do regularly.<br><br>Before taking a look at bird cages, choose the species of bird that you desire.<strong>Various species</strong> of birds <strong>require different sorts of cages</strong>.<br><br>Try to set your cage near a window so that it can have sun and fresh air. However, you do not need to place your bird near any ports.<br><br><a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cage-accessories/products/bird-platform-perch-1" title="perches"><strong>Perches</strong></a> are <strong>an essential part of a birdcage</strong>. You will want to place a few perches on your bird cage so that your bird may have various views. Multiple perches will also give your bird with opportunities to work out.<br><br>You will find inexpensive ways to create perches yourself, such as small fruit tree branches or utilize some sturdy rope. A perch needs to be next to the water and food containers.</p> <p>Birds must be stimulated frequently, and bird toys are one way to provide this stimulation. Like people, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">birds like new toys</span>. However, that does not mean that you’ll have to purchase new toys all of the time.</p> <p>You can even recycle items you have around your house like old toilet paper rolls, strings of plastic beads or older gloves. Birds enjoy playing with wooden balls or milk cartons. You might also try to place colorful things in a transparent bottle, and watch your bird go mad trying to get the jar open.

There are several factors to consider when making your decision, but the specifics will depend on the type of bird or birds you'll be keeping.<br><br></p> <h3>Size:</h3> <p>Size definitely matters when it comes to buying a bird cage. Ideally, you should purchase the largest cage that you can afford. You should also consider how much space you have available, especially if you're going to be keeping birds who don't enjoy human contact and therefore spend much of their time in their <u>cage</u>. The minimum size your <u>bird cage</u> depends on the type of bird that will be living in it. For instance, a small bird like a finch can get by with a minimum cage size of 45x45x75 cm, whereas a large macaw would require a cage of at least 90x120x150 cm. The breeder, animal shelter or pet shop from which you get your bird should be able to tell you what size cage to purchase.<br><br></p> <h3>Bar Spacing:<br><br> </h3> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/lock-me-up-8.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">It's not just the size you need to consider, you also need to buy a <u>bird cage</u> with the appropriately space between the bars. If the bars of a bird cage are too far apart for the bird you're keeping, it could escape or get caught in between the bars and become injured.<br><br>However, bars that are too close together might not provide a pleasant environment for the cage's inhabitants. Again, correct bar spacing depends on the species of bird you're going to be keeping, so you'll need to research the best bar spacing for your feathered friend.<br><br><br></p> <h3>Material:</h3> <p> </p> <p>Material is another vital consideration when it comes to picking out a bird cage. Wire or metal <u>cages</u> are generally the most common. They're durable and affordable, but can rust if they get wet and aren't always the most attractive option. You can get painted wire cages, but if you choose to go down this road, pick a powder-coated bird cage, as the paint is non-toxic and won't chip. Stainless steel cages are much more durable and don't rust, but can be more pricey.</p> <p><br>Picking the right cage for your pet bird is an important decision, and should not be taken lightly. Choose carefully, so that your feathered friend gets the best house you can give him.</p> <p> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
