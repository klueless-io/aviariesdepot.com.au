Moss makes the birdcage looks more earthy and unique.</p> <p>Things you will need:</p> <ul> <li>Birdcage/s</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Moss ( if you have any at home) or from any cheap store you can get it from</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Recycled cardboard from cereal box</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Glue gun + glue sticks</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Lace/flower garlands</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Pretty paper/poster board or index cards<br><br> </li> </ul> <h2> <strong>Steps on How to Do it:</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>First, trace the cardboard from a cereal box around your birdcage to make the base.</p> <p>Cut the cardboard out of cereal box, remove the excess, and make sure it fits inside the birdcage perfectly.</p> <p>Paste the moss on top utilizing the glue gun. You can likewise get rolls of moss that will make this activity a lot easier for you. In any case, they are unquestionably significantly more costly. I don't think it makes a difference. Tip: If you are sticking the moss on top of the cardboard, I suggest using a Post-it or some piece paper to help press the moss securely onto the cardboard. This will help keep your fingers from getting caught in the heated glue while on the process.</p> <p>Double check for if you missed a spot and cover them with more moss.</p> <p>Place the moss base inside the birdcage.</p> <p>Wrap lace/flower garland around the center. Utilize a string about a similar shade of the lace/garland to attach it to the bars. Next, hide the ends of the lace/garland behind the card sign and sew the ends together with a needle and thread. I'm certain you could stick the ends together, or simply leave it as it is, since nobody will notice it.</p> <p>Make the card sign. You can either print it with a font of your choice or write it using a nice pen/marker. Make sure the writing matched the clors of the lace/garland to make it look uniform.</p> <p>Cut out the sign and tape it to the index card. You can use two index cards taped together but you probably could get away with just one, or just use other nice paper and cut out any excess.</p> <p>Lastly, tape the sign to the birdcage. You can also use some yarn to tie it and then tie the sign to the birdcage.</p> <p>And done! Appreciate your work and admire how nice it looks compared to what it looks like before you remodelled it. Good job! Again, birdcages' usefulness do not limit only to one. You can always be resourceful, creative and imaginative to make your home a nice place to stay with all those bird cage decorations you can make.</p> <p> </p>
