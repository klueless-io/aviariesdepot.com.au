So here are some important facts about these beautiful creatures that you need to know.<br><br></p> <h2>Bird Intelligence<br><br> </h2> <p>According to the National Audubon Society, birds <strong>have problem-solving skills and cognitive skills</strong> that show a high degree of intelligence. And many birds have to navigate thousands of miles twice a year just to migrate. They’re able to use tools and even count from left to right too!</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-1.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>They <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/birds-being-you-know-birds" title="Birds Being... You now "><strong>may develop emotional problems and self-destructive behaviors</strong></a> if you <strong>don’t interact with them regularly</strong>. That’s why mental stimulation and environmental enrichment are very important. That is why<strong> toys do contribute</strong> to the <strong>mental and physical growth of your bird</strong>. They are naturally active and they simply need this activity to stay in good shape too. <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-toys" title="bird toys"><strong>Toys of different shapes and colors as well as a variety of textures provide interest</strong></a>. For more variety of <strong>bird toys</strong> you can visit online stores like <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/">aviariesdepot.com.au</a>.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Birds are Easier to Take Care</strong><br><br> </h2> <p style="float: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-2.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;">Unlike the other pets we have in our house that require daily walks outside, a pet bird can be placed into its cage while you're away during the day or at work. But because birds are confined in the house than other types of pets, this doesn't automatically mean he will be any less challenging. <br><br>Many birds are <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/hear-our-voices" title="hear our voices"><strong>exceptionally vocal and noisy</strong></a>, so even if yours is hanging out in his cage on the other side of the house, chances are he'll be hard to ignore.<br><br><br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>They Require Minimal Grooming</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>Birds are <strong>indeed hygienic animals</strong> and they preen their feathers daily to keep them shiny and clean. Preening is how birds keep their feathers looking clean. Healthy birds spend a great deal of preening because having neat feathers is very important to a bird’s survival. Feathers keep the bird shielded, weatherproofed, and they even help a bird find a mate.</p> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-3.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">A preening bird looks like he is “unsettling” his feathers with its beak. Birds like to preen after a bath and after meals. You will notice the bird shake out his feathers after preening and may see a puff of dust coming from the bird. This is part debris and part powder down.<br><br><a href="https://amzn.to/2M52fPs" target="_blank" title="SPI Home 33562 Curious Cat and Bird Birdbath" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Regular bird bath</strong></a> can reduce the amount of powder down your bird generates. A bird that<strong> stopped preening might need a medical attention</strong> and should see a vet right away. He may be ill or extremely uncomfortable with his living situation.<br><br> And also, they keep themselves neat, so you don’t have to worry about giving those baths to keep them clean (some birds love baths too!). If you have your bird out of its cage frequently then you’ll just have to keep an eye out for if your bird does any droppings, but other than this, mess won’t be a problem.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>They are Social Creatures</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>Birds have the capacity to bond just as closely with their humans as dogs and cats. And in fact, birds are <strong>much more socially inclined than kitties</strong>. With proper training and socialization, birds can be every bit as loving and affectionate. Some pet birds are attached from their owners, even accompanying them on daily errands. You can definitely train them to do simple tricks and tasks since they are highly intelligent creatures.</p> <p><strong>I’ll give some easy bonding activities you can do with your birds:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Sharing food</strong> with your bird is a great way to help him see you as part of his flock. Giving your feathered friend a meal can go a long way in making your bird see that you mean no harm. If you choose to offer your bird a tasty treat from your plate, make sure that the food you are sharing is free of salt and seasonings and is safe for birds to eat. If the bird is uncertain about trying a food, put a bite into his bowl and eat your share in front of him. Speak softly and talk about how good the food is.</p> </li> </ul> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-4.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>If at first your bird doesn't see you as much of a friend</strong>, then try singing some of your favorite songs to your pet and dance around. Sounds a bit silly, but most birds can't resist joining in the fun.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <ul> <li> <p><strong>Play with your bird</strong> in order to produce a happy and well-adjusted pet. You can also teach your bird a few fun bird tricks. It can do wonders for your relationship with your pet and your bird's general level of happiness. Plus, it's a blast to be able to show off how smart your pet is to friends and family! Just remember not to push your bird too much, and to keep your sessions short, fun, and consistent.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <h2><strong>Inexpensive to Feed</strong></h2> <p style="float: left;"><a href="https://www.beautyofbirds.com/birdnutrition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-5.jpg" style="float: left; margin: 10px;"></a>Any nutritious food items (plant-based - fruits, vegetables, nuts, grains) that you and your family eat, can and also be provided to your bird. There are some exceptions and make sure you know what those are.<br><br>It's important to provide pet birds with a high-quality pellet diet, but they can also benefit greatly from foods that their owners share with them.<br>When you serve fresh fruits or vegetables in your home, you can set a slice aside for your bird's meal. This provides them with additional nutrients and selection and allows owners to "stretch out" the common diets they buy.<br><br>Make sure you try many different kinds of foods. If one pellet isn’t eaten, don’t assume all will be refused. Visit <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/foods-and-treats-for-bird" title="Foods and Treats For Bird "><strong>Foods and Treats For Bird</strong></a> for more information about your bird's needs.</p> <p style="float: left;"><br>Organic or all-natural dry mixes are highly recommended. If broccoli is disliked, try sprouts, etc. Don’t just feed what is favorite. <strong>Be creative</strong>. Always add something new to old favorites. "<strong>Commercial diets" often contain artificial additives</strong> which may be bad for your pet bird. If organic or all-natural mixes aren't available, it is best to buy unfortified mixes and add a good quality bird supplement instead.<br><br>Fruits, vegetables (including leafy greens), sprouted seeds should compose approximately ¼ of your bird's nourishment. Note that light vegetables, including celery or iceberg, offer very little nutritional value.<br><br>Dried fruits and veggies also help transform "seed lovers" to a healthier diet. When fresh fruits and vegetables are not available, dehydrated fruits and vegetables work wonderfully. This dry fruits and veggies are loved by birds because of its crunchiness, or they chuck them into their water dish and then eat them once they are rehydrated. Be ready to change the water more often throughout the day. This dried fruits and vegetables have the benefit that they don't go off. You could leave them in their cages for days (unless they get soaked on water and never eaten). This is very convenient when traveling.<br><br>Just make sure always that any food that you share and give to these birds aren’t toxic. Do a research before giving them anything.<br><br><br></p> <h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Minimal Mess<br><br></strong></h2> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-6.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p><u><br></u>Bird lovers do get a little help by the fact that many of today’s cages are designed with mess management in mind. Cages today are made to lessen mess, but they can’t completely eradicate it. But not to worry — with the right accessories, you can keep the cage and your surroundings relatively clean. I’ll list down some things to remember when you’re cleaning the cage daily.<br><br></p> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul> <li>Change cage liners<br><br> </li> <li>Spot cleaning the grate, cage, perches and toys with bird-safe cleaners.<br><br> </li> <li>Throw out uneaten food items that are be apt to spoil after a couple of hours.<br><br> </li> <li>Wash and disinfect the soft <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/products/4pcs-water-bottle-feeder-1" title="food and water containers"><strong>food dish and water dish</strong></a>.<br><br> </li> <li>Sweep and vacuum around the cage area.<br><br><br> </li> </ul> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul style="padding-left: 30px;"></ul> </div> <div style="padding-left: 30px;"> <ul></ul> </div> <ul></ul> <h2><strong>Not Much Space Required<br><br></strong></h2> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-7.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">If you’re living in a house or apartment with not much room, then a bird might be just the pet for you. As long as you’ve got sufficient area for the cage then you’re set! There is also the option to get a hanging cage, which totally eliminates the need for any space at all. A bird is happy strolling around a small apartment, so don’t worry about it being damaging to them. They’re happy wherever you are.<br><br>Your <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/blogs/news/birds-habitat" title="birds habitat"><strong>bird’s environment</strong></a> is very significant, and though it seems as though what’s inside his cage would be more so, it is just as important to find the exact location in your house for your <a href="https://aviariesdepot.com.au/collections/bird-cages" title="bird cages"><strong>birdcage.</strong></a> This location is a basic part of your bird’s environment and daily life and a healthy bird must live in a well-placed cage. Doing so will make your life and your bird’s much calmer and more enjoyable. The amount of space should be large enough for the birds to stretch their wings, and allow for some flight, but also for your birds to hop, climb, feed, socialize, and parade other natural behaviors.<br><br>Long-tailed species, such as parakeets, cockatiels, and macaws, will need housing that will accommodate their tails as they move around. If a cage is too small for these long-tailed species, the tails may become damaged.</p> <p>So be sure first if you have the <strong>right kind of space for a specific bird</strong>. We don’t want to stress out our feathered friends and place them anywhere in our home. </p> <h3> <br><br><strong><span style="color: #38761d;">Guidelines to Finding the Right Spot in your House:</span></strong><br><br> </h3> <h3>Keep it Level:</h3> <p>Wherever you put your bird cage, make sure it’s <strong>not too high or too low</strong>; <strong>around chest level is perfect.</strong> Birds get scared and anxious if they’re too low. If they’re up higher than eye level, they’ll take it as a sign that they are superior to their owners. If they’re even higher, they will feel isolated from the people below.<br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h3>Family Interaction:</h3> <p>Place your birdcage in a place where your birds will <strong>be able to regularly see and interact with your family</strong>. Birds love attention and would be bored and lonely in an empty, unused room. Make sure that you don’t put the cage in one of the busiest, high-volume centers of your house. While birds <strong>love communication</strong>, too much noise and commotion will cause the bird to be restless and could lead to health problems.<br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h3>Walls and Windows:</h3> <p>If your cage is in the center of a room, your birds will feel uneasy and scared, as they have nowhere to hide from danger. Birds need <strong>at least one side of their cage up against a wall,</strong> as it gives them a <strong>feeling of security</strong>.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-8.jpg" style="float: none; margin: 10px auto; display: block;"></p> <p>The ideal location is in a corner where they can have two walls. Additionally, you <strong>shouldn’t put your bird’s cage straight in front of a window</strong>, as outside factors like dogs, hawks, and storms will shock them. The temperature can rapidly change by a window as well. A <strong>partial view of a window is okay</strong>.<br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h3>Heat Changes:</h3> <p>Try not to keep your bird <strong>close to a heat or air conditioning vent</strong> as the rapid changes in temperature are unhealthy.<br><br></p> <ul></ul> <h3>Prohibited Rooms:</h3> <p style="float: right;"><img alt="" src="/img/news/why-birds-make-great-pets-9.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 10px;">You <strong>should not</strong> put your birdcage in the <strong>kitchen</strong>. It can get too hot for your bird, and the fumes from cooking is toxic. Other issues, such as open flames, sharp edges, and dangerous appliances make the kitchen unsafe for any bird.<br><br>On a similar note, don’t keep your birdcage in the bathroom. In addition to the sudden change of heat and humidity, there are too many toxic chemicals that could poison the bird.<br><br></p> <h3>Toxic Places:</h3> <p>Keep your bird’s cage away from <strong>anything that could be toxic</strong>. This includes not only man-made poisons like air fresheners and scented candles but also naturally poisonous plants like oleander, azalea, poinsettia, and philodendron. Also, if you have any smokers in the house, make sure they don’t smoke anywhere near the bird. The vapors from cigarettes can be toxic to a bird.</p> <ul></ul> <p>If you follow these, your bird will have a safe, healthy, and fun home! Birds are loyal, amusing and grow their own wonderful and unique personalities. They’re also relatively long-lived, so you’ll be enjoying their company for years to come.</p> <p> </p> <style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style><style type="text/css"><!-- td {border: 1px solid #ccc;}br {mso-data-placement:same-cell;} --></style>
