Squab reaches full development between the ages of 4 to 6 weeks. By that time they can start consuming adult feed.</p> <p style="float: left;">When pigeon hen lays eggs and then hatches chicks, the hen and his mate can do most of the work in taking care of their squab.

After the 5<sup>th</sup> day you can now switch into a much bigger feeding syringe.<br><br>Always leave a small dish with clean drinking water inside the cage and teach your baby pigeons to drink by dipping her beak into it.<br><br>At about 3 weeks old, you can now leave small numbers of seeds in the squab’s cage so she can start learning to peck. You can do hand feeding a baby pigeon once a day until the day comes that obviously your squab can enjoy eating and drinking on her own.<br><br><br></p> <h2> <strong>Pigeons and Children</strong><br><br> </h2> <p>Nowadays, schools raise pigeons to connect children with history, nature and to empower them with life skills.This results to increasing their interest in science, math and health.
